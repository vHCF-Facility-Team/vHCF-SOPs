## 2. Controller Certifications

### 2.1 Certification Requirements

All controllers staffing HCF positions must be certified per this policy.

## 3. Training Procedures

### 3.1 Scheduling Training

1. Training is scheduled through the Scheddy application, which can be found on <https://scheddy.vhcf.net/>. Booking a session serves as a reservation and the booked trainer will let the student know if the session will happen or not.
2. A new request will be required for each session.

### 3.2 Training Expectations

As a student, you are expected to:

- Take responsibility for your own progress and allocate time for your training.
- Follow the scheduling training processes outlined above.
- Come prepared for sessions to the best of your ability including self-study of ATC Orders, VATUSA Academy materials, facility procedures, and any other applicable reference resources.
- Review areas of deficiencies listed on the training ticket posted on the HCF website or the VATUSA page and come prepared to discuss those areas in subsequent lessons.
- Seek clarification on any material not immediately understood. This may be accomplished through direct interaction with their trainer or by means of self-study.
- Be receptive to feedback/critique.
- Students are prohibited from recording, streaming, or otherwise broadcasting all training events without explicit permission from the trainer.

### 3.3 Cancellations

1. Students and trainers should give reasonable notice when cancelling a session. Reasonable notice is greater than twelve (12) hours in advance of the training session. However, more time is preferred.
2. Trainers should wait at least fifteen (15) minutes after the scheduled start time for a student to show. Unless otherwise coordinated, all training sessions will be conducted on the HCF Discord Server.
3. Any student that does not show within fifteen minutes of the scheduled start time may be considered a "no-show".
4. Repeated no-shows may result in suspension from scheduling future training sessions for a period of up to 30 days, or other disciplinary action.

### 3.4 Rating Examination Scheduling

Rating Examinations are used to determine if students meet the criteria for promotion to the next VATSIM rating. When a student is ready for their Rating Examinations the student is assigned an instructor, this cannot be their primary instructor. The OTS instructor will reach out to the student to schedule the exam.

### 3.5 Rating Examinations

1. Rating Examinations test students on either a simulated or live basis on practical applications for the purpose of rating promotions.
2. HCF conducts Rating Examinations for the following VATSIM rating changes at the conclusion of the listed training courses:
   1. S2 – Advanced Local (TWR)
   2. S3 – Terminal Radar Control (APP)
   3. C1 - Enroute Radar Control (CTR)
3. Students are prohibited from recording, streaming, or otherwise broadcasting an Rating Examinations.

### 3.6 Rating Consolidation

1. All home controllers must complete a consolidation period by controlling qualifying positions (see table below for qualifying positions) prior to requesting access to the Academy Course and/or requesting training for the next rating.

| Certification Course / Rating Sought | Advanced Local | Terminal Radar Control | Enroute Radar Control |
| --- | :---: | :---: | :---: |
| Qualifying Positions | DEL<br>S-GND<br>GND<br>S-TWR | TWR | APP |

2. Advanced Local consolidation period: **30 Hours on qualifying positions.**
3. Terminal Radar Control consolidation period: **50 Hours on qualifying positions.**
4. Enroute Radar Control consolidation period: **50 Hours on qualifying positions.**
5. For clarity, the certification courses used within section 3.6 correspond directly to the naming conventions used by VATSIM as follows:
   1. Advanced Local = Aerodrome Controller (S2)
   2. Terminal Radar Control = Terminal Controller (S3)
   3. Enroute Radar Control = Enroute Controller (C1)

## 4. Courses

### 4.1 Course Development Theory

#### 4.1.1 Scope

Courses in this curriculum are designed to be narrow in scope. This allows students to choose what to pursue next so they can focus on what interests them. It also allows for quick certification without degrading competencies. This all culminates in enhanced motivation for the student, empowered to focus on the fun.

#### 4.1.2 Competency Compliance

These courses adhere to all VATSIM/VATUSA policies and competencies. Each course should be built to comply with the competencies of the rating that will be issued at completion or the one most closely matching the areas of instruction.

#### 4.1.3 Lesson Development

Lessons should focus on a few unique skills or techniques, completed in no more than 45 to 75 minutes in most cases.

#### 4.1.4 Course Listing

The following is a complete listing of courses maintained by the Training Administrator to be administered to home controllers within HCF:

- Clearance Delivery and Flight Data (DEL)

- Advanced Local Control (TWR)
- Terminal Radar Control (APP)
- Enroute Radar Control (CTR)
- Basic Instructional Practices (MTR)
- Advanced Instructional Practices (INS)

### 4.2 Student Placement

Once a course has been implemented:

- New enrollments will start the course from the beginning.
- Students actively training in areas covered by that course will be placed on the appropriate lesson with their assigned trainer.
- Enrolments who have previously completed training related to the course but have been inactive for less than three months will be placed on the appropriate lesson with their assigned trainer.
