**Tasks:**

The tasks for APP-6 are those that are used during normal operations in a radar environment. The student will be evaluated on their ability to control the position solo and thus student should be able to control a combined TRACON with little to no intervention from the instructor.

**Completion Standards:** This lesson is completed when the student demonstrates the ability to manage traffic at a combined radar position at a Class C airport with minimal intervention from the instructor. The student must ensure separation minima are maintained, effectively handle arrivals and departures, and coordinate with adjacent sectors as necessary. Successful completion includes correct phraseology, timely handoffs, and a demonstration of readiness for the final certification exam.
