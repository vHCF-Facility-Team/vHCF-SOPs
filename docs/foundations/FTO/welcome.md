Guam ARTCC is one of 22 Enroute facilities that serves an area comprised of nearly 200,000 square miles of airspace. Our control area, which is part of the Oakland ARTCC Flight Information Region, is essentially a 250 nautical mile circle with Guam at its center and is predicated on the radar coverage available from one of our radar sites on the northern tip of Guam. Besides providing air traffic services for Guam, our facilityâ€™s airspace also encompasses the Northern Mariana Islands of Rota, Saipan, and Tinian. Our facility supports approximately 250,000 aircraft operations each year, which not only includes civilian air traffic but a considerable number of military aircraft. In fact, our facility is unique in that it supports a number of large-scale military exercises and special training missions which truly make this facility an especially challenging and exciting place to work.
