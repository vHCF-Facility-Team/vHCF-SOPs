# 5. Student 1 Training

## 5.1 - S1 Lesson 1 – Setup

Client Setup

- The current software client for VATSIM USA is **CRC**. (<https://vnas.vatsim.net/crc>)
- The most commonly used client for Ground Control and Clearance Delivery is **Tower Cab** mode.
- To setup **CRC**, download from the URL listed above.
- Your Mentor/Instructor will provide further detail with you on setting up the client and learning how to connect.
- Set your Visibility range in accordance with [VATSIM Code of Conduct](https://vatsim.net/docs/policy/code-of-conduct). For ground this should be 20nm or less.
- In addition to **CRC**, you will also be instructed to download/use **vSTRIPS** and **vTDLS**.
- **vStrips** is a web-based simulation of the paper flight progress strips used by FAA controllers in air traffic control towers. The application is used alongside a primary controlling client, such as **CRC**. Controllers logged in to the same **vStrips** facility share a set of flight strip bays that auto-matically update whenever a controller adds, moves, edits, or deletes a flight strip.
- **vStrips** also offers a variety of features that mirror realistic workflows, including the ability to add separators between flight strips, create custom half-strips for temporary or VFR flight plans, and offset strips to the side of a rack.
- **vTDLS** is a high-fidelity simulation of the real-life FAA TDLS (Tower Data-Link Services) system that allows controllers to send pre-departure clearances (PDCs) to aircraft. **vTDLS** greatly reduces the workload of clearance-delivery controllers at equipped airports, particularly during departure-heavy events as it allows controllers to review flight plans and send PDCs to pilots before they even connect to the network.

## 5.2 - S1 Lesson 2 – Oral

**Airspace Information**

    Class E - Controlled airspace with only a transponder being required above C, above 10,000, and within a Class B mode C veil.
    Class D - Only two-way radio communication is needed. Only aircraft requesting radar services under approach control and IFR traffic need squawk codes.
    Class C - Aircraft are required to have a transponder and two-way radio communication. Most aircraft will be given a squawk code depending on direction, altitude, radar services, or intentions.
    Class B - Aircraft are required to have a clearance, transponder within the 30-mile mode C Veil, and two-way radio communication. All aircraft VFR or IFR will be given a squawk code.
    Class A - Aircraft are required to be on an IFR flight plan, clearance, transponder, and two-way radio communication.

**Clearance Information**

Clearances for IFR flight are given using the CRAFT acronym.

    Clearance Limit / Route of flight / Altitude / Frequency / Transponder Code.

Clearances for VFR operations in, out, or through Class B airspace is as follows. *"N123AB CLEARED THROUGH/TO ENTER/OUT OF BRAVO AIRSPACE"*

## 5.3 - S1 Lesson 3 – Oral

**Movement vs Non-Movement**

Movement area is areas on the airport such as taxiways and runways. These are areas that aircraft must have permission to move about, takeoff, or land on.

Non-Movement area is areas on the airport such as the terminal ramp, general aviation ramp, or military ramps. These are locations that aircraft can move about without permission from the controller.

**Taxi Information**

- Fixed Wing - These aircraft taxi about the normal way you see on an airport if you was flying on an airliner or flying with a friend. The correct way to issue a taxi clearance is *"FDX9260 Runway 4R taxi via C Altimeter 30.11" or "FDX9260 taxi to parking via C"*
  - Note that you do not have to give the altimeter if they call with the current ATIS or numbers.
- Helicopters - Helicopters have several ways they can taxi. They can surface taxi, hover taxi, or air taxi. However, helicopters will generally take off from present position.
  - Surface Taxi - Helicopters have wheels and would taxi like a normal aircraft.
  - Hover Taxi - When requested or necessary for a helicopter/ VTOL aircraft to proceed at a slow speed above the surface, normally below 20 knots and in ground effect, use the following phra-seology.
    - *"Helicopter N123AB runway 4R hover taxi via C"* If needed you can issue CAUTION (dust, blow-ing snow, loose debris, taxiing light aircraft, personnel, etc.).
  - Air Taxi - When requested or necessary for a helicopter to proceed expeditiously from one point to another, normally below 100 feet AGL and at airspeeds above 20 knots, use the following phra-seology.
    - *"Helicopter N123AB Air Taxi via (direct, as requested, or specified route) TO (location, heliport, helipad, operating/movement area, active/inactive runway) AVOID (aircraft/vehicles/person-nel). If required, REMAIN AT OR BELOW (altitude). CAUTION (wake turbulence or other reasons above). LAND AND CONTACT TOWER, or HOLD FOR (reason− takeoff clearance, release, land-ing/taxiing aircraft, etc.).”*

**RVSM Airspace**

Reduced vertical separation minima or minimum (RVSM) is the reduction, from 2,000 feet to 1,000 feet, of the standard vertical separation required between aircraft flying between flight level 290 (29,000 ft) and flight level 410 (41,000 ft). This reduction in vertical separation minima therefore increases the num-ber of aircraft that can fly in a particular volume of controlled airspace.

Aircraft must be RVSM capable to cruise between FL290 and FL410. Aircraft can cruise above FL410 non RVSM capable however, they cannot level off in RVSM airspace.

Above RVSM airspace separation will be 2,000 ft resulting in all cruising altitudes being odds alternating for direction of flight.

## 5.4 - S1 Lesson 4 – Oral

**Equipment Codes**

You will see an image attached with the most common/simple equipment suffixes that include both RVSM and non RVSM codes.
