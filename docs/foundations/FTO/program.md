# 4. Training Program Information

The Honolulu Control Facility training program is designed to keep our training standardized and aligned to VATUSA standards as well as being VATSIM Global Ratings Policy compliant. This program will be broken into units and lessons to allow a standardized way of teaching students effectively and efficiently. The goal of this program is to have every student proficient by the end of each course to utilize a solo certification.

## 4.1 - Training Syllabus - Introduction

Below is the guideline of which the CIT student training will be completed to ensure competency for the appropriate rating. The MTR/INS will help guide the CIT student through the units and lessons to help teach the CIT student the information needed to become an effective controller and comply with the VATSIM GCAP and VATUSA training guideline.

## 4.2 - Training Waiting Times

In order to allow controllers to gain proper experience on their new rating before starting with the next training, HCF implements the following waiting times before the next rating can be started:

- S1 -> S2: 30+ days
- S2 -> S3: 30+ days
- S3 -> C1: 60+ days

These waiting times serve the purpose that the controller can learn on other positions as well and learn the procedures there which is most important for Enroute positions where the new Controller needs to be able to control all positions top-down.

The times are at a minimum. Additional to the waiting time, Training Staff will observe the Controller and decide when the Controller is ready for the next rating training.
