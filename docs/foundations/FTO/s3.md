# 7. Student 3 Training - TRACON

## 7.1 - S3 Lesson 1

Below is the guideline of which the CIT student training will be completed to ensure competency for the S3 rating. MTR/INS will help guide the CIT student through the units and lessons to help teach the CIT student the information needed to become an effective controller as well as comply with the VATSIM GCAP, VATUSA training guideline, and the S3 OTS Rubric.

### 7.1.1 - Class D Service

A class D airport can have an approach position. Hilo is an example of a class D that has a TRACAB, but is not identified on a sectional. The approach sector provides approach services to aircraft within the approach airspace. One main thing about a TRSA is that VFR participation is OPTIONAL. VFR aircraft are NOT REQUIRED to contact the approach controller outside the D and inside the TRSA.

### 7.1.2 - Class C Service

- Provide Class C services to all aircraft operating within Class C airspace.
- Provide Class C services to all participating aircraft in the outer area.
- Class C services include the following:
  - Sequencing of all aircraft to the primary airport.
  - Standard IFR services to IFR aircraft.
  - Separation, traffic advisories, and safety alerts between IFR and VFR aircraft.
  - Traffic advisories and safety alerts between VFR aircraft.

### 7.1.3 - VFR Aircraft Separation

- TRSA and Class C- Separate VFR aircraft from VFR/IFR aircraft by any one of the following
  - Visual separation
  - 500 feet vertical separation.
- Class B - VFR aircraft must be separated from VFR/IFR aircraft/ helicopter/rotor craft that weigh more than 19,000 pounds and turbojets by no less than: 1 1/2 miles separation, or 500 feet verti-cal separation, or Visual separation.
- VFR aircraft must be separated from all VFR/IFR aircraft which weigh 19,000 pounds or less by a minimum of: 500 feet vertical separation, or Visual separation

### 7.1.4 - Radar Identification

- Identify a primary, radar beacon, or ADS−B target by using one of the following methods:
  - Observing a departing aircraft target within 1 mile of the takeoff runway end at airports with an operating control tower, provided one of the following methods of coordination is accomplished.
  - Observing a target whose position with respect to a fix (displayed on the video map, scribed on the map overlay, or displayed as a permanent echo) or a visual reporting point (whose range and azimuth from the radar antenna has been accurately determined and made available to the controller) corresponds with a direct position report received from an aircraft, and the observed track is consistent with the reported heading or route of flight. If a TACAN/VORTAC is located within 6,000 feet of the radar antenna, the TACAN/VORTAC may be used as a reference fix for radar identification without being displayed on the video map or map overlay.
  - Observing a target make an identifying turn or turns of 30 degrees or more
  - Request the pilot to activate the “IDENT” feature of the transponder/ADS−B and then observe the identification display.
  - Request the pilot to change to a specific discrete or non-discrete code, as appropriate, and then observe the target or code display change. If a code change is required in accordance with Section 2, Beacon/ADS−B Systems, of this chapter, use the codes specified therein.
  - Request the pilot to change their transponder/ ADS−B to “standby.” After you observe the target disappear for sufficient scans to assure that loss of target resulted from placing the transponder/ADS−B in “standby” position, request the pilot to return the transponder to normal op-eration and then observe the reappearance of the target.

### 7.1.5 - Minimum Altitudes

- MVA - Minimum Vectoring Altitude
- MIA - Minimum Instrument Altitude
- MSA - Minimum Safe Altitude
- MEA - Minimum Enroute Altitude

## 7.2 - S3 Lesson 2

### 7.2.1 - One-In One-Out Rule

Uncontrolled fields are only allowed to have one instrument arrival or departure at a time. Other IFR traffic for the airport where the clearance is issued is suspended until the aircraft has contacted ATC or until 30 minutes after the clearance void time or 30 minutes after the clearance release time if no clearance void time is issued.

Once an aircraft is cleared for an approach and switched to advisory, they only have 30 minutes to cancel their IFR flight plan. You cannot release another IFR departure from the field or clear another IFR arrival into the field until the cancellation is received.

The correct phraseology for an arrival is ***"(Call sign) NO OBSERVED TRAFFIC BETWEEN YOU AND THE (XXX) AIRPORT. RADAR SERVICE TERMINATED. REPORT CANCELLATION OF IFR IN THE AIR OR ON THE GROUND ON THIS FREQUENCY. FREQUENCY CHANGE APPROVED to CTAF"***

For aircraft that pickup their IFR clearance on the ground utilize the phrase **AS FILED** as much as applicable. Ensure at the end of every clearance you utilize **HOLD FOR RELEASE**. “Hold for release” instructions must be used when necessary to inform a pilot or a controller that a departure clearance is not valid until additional instructions are received.

When releasing a departure utilize the following phraseology:

***“(ACFT CALLSIGN), RELEASED FOR DEPARTURE AT (TIME), CLEARANCE VOID IF NOT OFF BY (CLEARANCE VOID TIME), IF NOT OFF BY (CLEARANCE VOID TIME), ADVISE HNL CTR NOT LATER THAN (TIME) OF INTENTIONS.”***

### 7.2.2 - Approach Charts

It is very important that every controller understands how approach charts work. Without an under-standing of how approach charts work then you cannot control effectively. Below is a list of items you should understand by the end of this section after reviewing charts with your MTR/INS.

- Feeder fixes
- Initial Approach Fixes
- Procedure turns and when they are not applicable
- MSA's - Minimum Safe Altitudes
- TAA's - Terminal Arrival Areas

### 7.2.3 - Pop-Up IFR

Aircraft are not required to pick up an IFR flight plan on the ground. Aircraft can pick up an IFR flight plan in the air if they encounter less than VFR weather, if they end up wanting to proceed IFR, or depart a controlled airport VFR with a filed IFR flight and pick up the flight plan in the air. When a pilot does this instruct the pilot the MAINTAIN VFR and issue them a squawk code same as for flight following. When able ask applicable information to fill out the flight plan if not filed and clear them normally except no expected altitude or squawk. Example *"N123AB cleared to Kona via direct maintain 4,000"*

### 7.2.4 - APPROACH PHRASEOLOGY

How to clear onto the final approach course.
<p style="text-align: center;font-style:italic;">Three miles from final approach fix. Turn left heading zero one zero. Maintain two thousand until estab-lished on the localizer. Cleared I−L−S runway three six approach.</p>

How to clear from an IAF or feeder fix.

<p style="text-align: center;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">Cross XXX at or above XXX cleared RNAV runway 17 approach.<br><br>Three miles from XXX cleared ILS runway 17C approach. (If already on an approach segment.)</p>

### 7.2.5 - Holding

Aircraft may have to hold for a variety of reason. They may have to burn off fuel, there may be an aircraft already cleared into the uncontrolled field, there may be traffic delays at the destination, the weather may be shifting and have to frequency, they may have an issue, or maybe they just request to hold.

<p style="text-align: center;font-weight:bold;font-style:italic;">CLEARED TO (fix), HOLD (direction), AS PUBLISHED, EXPECT FURTHER CLEARANCE (time)</p>
