# 2. Training Policy

## 2.1 - Training Flow

### 2.1.1 - General

Controllers-In-Training (CIT) are expected to begin training after reviewing the applicable HCF Facility General Operating Procedures (GOP), Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs), and additional training documentation as well as any materials suggested by the facility training staff.

The CIT will train with a Mentor/Instructor (MTR/INS) to guide them through their rating. To schedule training, the CIT is responsible to request training for the applicable rating or checkout. This will be done by following the instructions in the CONTROLLER TRAINING channel, #training-requests on the Dis-cord Server.

The CIT is strongly encouraged to log into the network as an OBS to observe controllers and MTR/INS working air traffic, especially for preparing to train on a position.

### 2.1.2 - Home Controller Flow

An OBS/CIT student is expected to review the VATUSA training material, the General Operations Policy and Training Department Policy, training syllables, and any additional training material provided by the HCF training staff. Observers are expected to self-study basic concepts provided during their training sessions.

All training will be conducted as outlined in the training syllabus (see listing). The CIT student should look ahead to the next lesson to understand and prepare what will be required.

Each lesson shall be satisfactorily completed prior to moving on to the next lesson. If the CIT student is having a difficult time advancing to the next lesson, they should be referred to the TA for review.

- Solo Certifications shall only be issued upon all lessons being satisfactorily completed.
- Solo Certifications for HNL TWR, HCF APP, and HCF CTR shall be issued in compliance with VATUSA Training policy (DP002).

### 2.2.2 - No-Show Policy

In case either party is running late, it is required for both parties, CIT student or MTR/INS, to wait at least 15 minutes after the scheduled training time before considering the session to be a No-Show. Additionally, sessions may also be considered a No-Show if they are canceled less than six hours from the start of the session.

The CIT student is responsible for showing up to their requested/scheduled training sessions on time and fully prepared. In the event the CIT student does not show up for their session, disciplinary action will follow a 3-strike system:

1. Upon the first no show, the CIT student shall be warned though the training notes left for the training session.
2. Upon the second no show, the CIT student shall be warned via email by the TA and reminded of the actions. At the discretion of the TA, a hold shall be placed on the CIT students account, during which the CIT student will not be allowed to book any training sessions. This hold shall be in place for no more than 7 days starting from the end time of the training session that the CIT student did not attend.
3. Upon the third no show, and to any subsequent no shows, at the discretion of the TA, a hold shall be placed on the CIT students account, during which the CIT student will not be allowed to book any training sessions regardless of date. This hold shall be in place for no more than 14 days starting from the end time of the training session that the CIT student did not attend. The CIT student shall be notified of all holds and their end time via email from the TA.

### 2.2.3 - Scheduled Training Cancellation
