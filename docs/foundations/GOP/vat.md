# 4. Visiting and Transferring Controllers

## 4.1 - Visiting Controllers

The process for becoming a visiting controller at the Honolulu Control Facility is initiated via the “Visiting Application” page on the website. Visitors shall take and pass the HCF entry exam*. Assuming the controller does not have any disciplinary issues, prospective visitors shall:

- Controlled no less than 50 hours in their current rating at their Home ARTCC
- Shall have their current rating for at least 90 days since promotion
- Hold a minimum S3 rating

<p style="text-align: center;">*note, as of this writing, the HCF visitor exam is being written and is not in effect yet.</p>

**Controlling at Unrestricted Fields**

After joining, Visiting Controllers may operate at any Unrestricted Airport positions to which their endorsement applies.

**Controlling in Tier 2 Airspace**

Prior to controlling at HNL (Honolulu) Approach or Honolulu Center (Enroute), a controller must be approved by an HCF Instructor to operate either of these positions. As per Section 8 of the VATSIM GCAP Policy, familiarization for HNL APP and/or HNL CTR will be applied along with some simulated training and/or written exam prior to approval to control this position.

Prior to controlling on HNL TWR or HNL GND, a controller will first be required to do a familiarization session with an HCF Instructor or Mentor.

## 4.2 - Visitor Controllers from Outside VATUSA Division

Visitor Controllers from outside the VATUSA Division will first be required to take the Ratings Competency Exam (RCE) prior to applying to be a Visitor Controller at HCF. Details to take the RCE exam can be found here https://www.vatusa.net/help/kb#q12 Go to question #5.

Failure to pass any checkout or RCE exam will result in a referral to their home facility and VATUSA3 detailing what competencies were missed. The HCF TA, Home Facility TA and VATUSA3 may discuss further training at the home facility. Visitor controllers will be held to the currency requirements as Home Controllers.

## 4.3 - Transferring Controllers

Once a transfer to HCF has been approved through VATUSA, the new member will be added to the HCF roster. The controller may then operate at any Unrestricted Airport positions to which their endorsement applies.

Familiarization for any HNL (Honolulu) position will be applied along with some simulated training and/or written exam prior to approval to control these positions. Following familiarization, the controller may operate HNL GND, HNL TWR or any Tier 2 position to which their endorsement applies. Should the transferring controller hold a rating of OBS they will be treated as a new controller
