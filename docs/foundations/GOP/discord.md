# 3. Discord and Streaming

## 3.1 - Discord

HCF maintains a Discord server for controllers. Discord is the primary voice communication for coordination. This Discord server is only for members who are home controllers, visitors, or VATUSA staff. Any additional members must be approved by the ATM or DATM and will be considered a temporary guest. Discord information can be found on the HCF website.

Voice Channels under Coordination are to be used for active coordination. Members who are not controlling that position will be allowed to be in the channel, but must leave upon the active controllerâ€™s request. Any disruptions of active controlling or coordination and refusal to leave may result in disciplinary action. Members actively controlling any airspace within HCF shall be in one of the voice servers for coordination.

## 3.2 - Streaming

When utilized properly, streaming can be helpful with promoting HCF and VATSIM. Controllers are authorized and encouraged to stream while actively controlling a position. While streaming the following policies are in place:

1. Audio from Discord must not be streamed.
2. Your conduct directly represents HCF and your Senior Staff, as such the policies outlined in this document as well as VATSIM CoC and CoR apply.
3. Stream Sniping is not allowed and may result in administrative action not limited to, removal from the HCF Roster and/or suspension from the network.
