# 2. ARTCC Policies

## 2.1 - General Requirements

- When logging in on a position, that position should be staffed for at least one (1) hour unless the controller changes to another position or another controller takes over.

## 2.2 - Activity Requirements

In order to maintain active status, members must meet the current VATUSA Global Controller Administration Policy (GCAP) standards.

All home and visiting controllers who possess the rating of S1 and higher shall log onto a controllable position a minimum of three (3) hours in a three-month period. These periods will be split into quarters as follows:

- Quarter 1 - January to March
- Quarter 2 - April to June
- Quarter 3 - July to September
- Quarter 4 - October to December

**(i.e., to maintain currency in quarter 3, a controller must log on to a position for three hours between July 1st and September 30th)**

If any member does not achieve currency, they will be removed from the roster. If after being removed a controller wishes to be reinstated on the HCF roster, they can make a request with any of the Senior Staff no less than 30 days from the date they were removed. The 30-day requirement can be waived at the discretion of the ATM/DATM on a case-by-case base. At that time, the Senior Staff will consider the request.

Visiting Controllers from Outside VATUSA Division are required to have 50%+1 controlling hours in their Home Division in accordance with the VATSIM Transfer and Visiting Controller Policy §2.2
