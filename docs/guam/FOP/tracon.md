# 5. Radar Control

The Guam CERAP consists of two main terminal radar sectors. The following explain each area, and their airspace.

## Guam Approach

- The Guam Approach which consists of GE and GW and establishes control over the Guam Airport and the Andersen Air Force Base.
  - Final operations in normal configuration for the fields are with GW, and are flipped when West flow is used.
- The Guam Approach consists of two main MVAs, the main one which covers both GUM and UAM has a floor of 023 (2,300). The other MVA is located on the southern part of Guam island, and has a floor of 026 (2,600).
- Both Guam Airport and Andersen Air Force Base should mirror the same runway operations; as they are 8 miles separated, and proper sequencing and separation needs to be applied for approaches into the fields.
  - If one airport switches operations, the other should be advised to do so within a 10 to 20 minute timeframe.
- Departures from both of these fields should be vectored onto a single stream for the directions: north, south, east, and west.

## Saipan Approach

- The Saipan Approach which consists of GS has control over Tinian Airport and Saipan Airport.
- The Saipan Approach holds one MVA over the two islands in the airspace that has a floor of 028 (2,800).
- There are no special rules for the 8-mile spacing of Tinian and Saipan. Though it is recommended that these airports mirror the same flow operations, yet is not mandatory.
- Departures from both of these fields should be vectored onto a single stream for the directions: north, south, east, and west.
- The Tinian Airport is uncontrolled, and therefore the One-In/One-Out rule must be applied for this field.

## Handoffs

- None of the fields are radar towers, so no Radar Handoffs to LC should be done.
- Departing IFR and VFR Flight Following aircraft shall be Radar handed off to the appropriate Center Controller once reaching the boundaries of the respected radar area, and clear of conflict

## VFR Aircraft

- VFR aircraft operating within either of the Class D airspace, or Andersen TRSA shall be kept at or below 4,000 feet.
- VFR aircraft arriving into Saipan, Andersen, or Guam will not receive pattern instructions, but must be provided with the field Altimeter, and verbally handed off to Local Control prior to entering the LC airspace.

## Departure Releases

- All fields are allotted automatic departure releases unless otherwise coordinated. The LC shall provide RADAR with rolling calls containing the following:
  - Aircraft Callsign
  - Initial Fix
  - Departure Runway

## Missed Approaches/Go-Arounds

- LC shall provide all missed approach aircraft runway heading and instructions to maintain 4,000.
- LC shall coordinate with RADAR for alternative headings / altitudes prior to the aircraft being handed off.
- LC is instructed to not assign published missed approach procedures unless requested or approved by RADAR.
- RADAR is responsible for the separation of missed approach aircraft re-entering the approach into the field.
- RADAR is NOT responsible for VFR aircraft declaring the missed approach.

## In-Trail Spacing

- RADAR shall ensure that aircraft have at least 3 miles in lateral separation, and 1,000 feet in vertical separation prior to being handed off to LC.
- CENTER shall ensure that aircraft have at least 5 miles in lateral separation prior to being handed off to RADAR.

## Departure Flows

- IFR aircraft departing one of the controlled fields shall be given a vector out of the radar area, and provide CENTER with a single-stream flow for the directions: north, south, east, and west.
- VFR Flight-Following aircraft departing one of the controlled fields shall be given directional instructions, or the arrangement of the following:
  - **Departing Guam Island**: follow the coastline east/west/south.
  - **Departing Saipan Island**: follow the coastline north/south.

## Arrival Flows

- IFR aircraft arriving into one of the controlled fields shall be given an altimeter and expected runway and approach.
- VFR Flight-Following aircraft arriving into one of the controlled fields shall be given directional instructions, and an altimeter prior to being handed off to LC.
