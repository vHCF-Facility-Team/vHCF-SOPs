# 4. Local Control

## Responsibilities

- LC is responsible for aircraft operating on all runways and aircraft operating within these designated LC controlled areas:
  - Guam Airport
    - All aircraft operating in-between both of the parallel runways shall maintain radio communication with LC, until a condition is met for a verbal handoff to occur.
    - Aircraft exiting the runway on taxiway J shall maintain radio communication with LC, unless coordinated otherwise with GC.
  - Andersen Air Force Base
    - All aircraft operating in-between both of the parallel runways shall maintain radio communication with LC, until a condition is met for a verbal handoff to occur.
  - Saipan Airport
    - All aircraft operating in-between both of the parallel runways on taxiways: B, D, and E, shall maintain radio communication with LC, until a condition is met for a verbal handoff to occur.
- Do not land or depart on runways with a tailwind component of more than 10 knots.
- LC must coordinate runway configuration changes with RADAR and GC, and must notify of the last departures from the prior configuration. LC must wait for RADAR notification of readiness before executing the new runway configuration.
- LC will not track or radar identify any departures or arrivals. None of the fields in the Guam CERAP are radar towers.
- Special VFR operations are prohibited.

## Departure Procedures

- LC receives automatic departure releases from RADAR for all IFR departures, unless coordinated otherwise. LC must provide RADAR with rolling calls.
- LC will verbally hand off aircraft off to RADAR once the aircraft establishes a positive rate through 500ft. MSL.
- LC will ensure that all IFR aircraft are handed off to RADAR no later than 1/2 mile off the end of the departure runway.
- LC at all fields own a 3-mile radius ( UAM: 4-miles ) from the center of the field. All VFR departures shall remain with LC until leaving this initial airspace, and verbally handed off to the respective frequencies

## Arrival Procedures

- Communication transfer must be completed prior to five nautical miles from the runway.
- LC shall provide VFR arrivals with entry instructions into the pattern and field altimeter.
- Land and Hold Short (LAHSO), and Line Up and Wait (LUAW) are NOT authorized at any Guam CERAP field

## Missed Approaches Go-Arounds

- At all Guam CERAP fields, assign runway heading, and climb to 4,000.
- Coordinate with RADAR for alternative headings / altitudes then handoff to RADAR.
- Do not assign the published missed approach procedure unless it is requested or approved by RADAR.

## Closed Traffic

| **Airport**  | **Runway** | **Direction** |
|--------------|------------|---------------|
| GUM/UAM      | 6L         | Left          |
| GUM/UAM      | 6R         | Right         |
