## 2.4 - Ground Stops

1. If Ground Stops are in effect, inform the aircraft after issuance of clearance and acknowledgement that there is a ground stop in effect and to monitor this frequency for further instructions.
2. Ensure you inform the aircraft their Estimated Departure Clearance Time (EDCT) if known, as well as the cause of the ground stop.
3. As all clearance delivery in the Guam CERAP occurs in the GC frequency, you will determine and notify the aircraft upon ready to taxi.
4. Upon release from the ground stop you must notify aircraft affected in order of clearance to “Push and start at pilot’s discretion, call for taxi.”
   1. If Ramp Control is active, Ramp Control takes over this part and steers push-backs and taxi in the non-movement area.
