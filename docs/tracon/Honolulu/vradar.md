   1. Area A - SFC – 030
   2. Area F - SFC – 015
   3. Area G - SFC – 020
   4. Area H - SFC – 040
   5. Area I - SFC – 030
   6. 4EXT - SFC – 030 (When requested)
2. Assigned airspace and RWY 22/26 configuration:

   2. Area D - SFC – 050
3. Assigned airspace and RWY 4/8, RWY 8L closed configuration
   1. Area A - SFC – 030
4. Request the delegation of the RWY 4R extension airspace (4EXT) from Sector 2 when needed.

## 5.2 - Control Instructions

1. Provides radar services within assigned airspace.
2. Establishes approach sequence to RWY 4R/L, 22R/L and sealanes when applicable. Aircraft inbound for sealane 4/8/22 must be indicated in the MEARTS scratch pad.
   1. L authorizes V control of aircraft inbound via the Freeway Arrival.
   2. Transfer of communications from L to V for aircraft inbound via the freeway must be completed prior to Koko Head during RWY 4/8.
   3. Clear aircraft into Class B upon initial contact from HCF Center.
3. V must sequence the north and freeway arrivals with straight-in arrivals to their assigned runway.
4. V must sequence arrivals as follows:
   1. RWY 22/26:
      1. V must clear or ensure (via scratch pad) small VFR propeller driven aircraft from the east enter Class B airspace via the KONA Arrival.
      2. The Tripler Arrival shall be the primary arrival route for VFR aircraft from the north/west in lieu of the North Arrival
      3. Approach must sequence arrivals to RWY 22L except:
         1. When RWY 22L is unavailable to arrivals, sequence to RWY 22R.
         2. When RWY 26R is unavailable for departures full length, sequence to RWY 22R.
      4. RWY 22L/22R arrivals must be 3 miles in trail or greater at the runway threshold.
   2. RWY 4/8:
      1. 0700-1730 HST Freeway arrivals or route similar to not authorized to RWY 4R (RWY 4L when RWY 4R is closed) for fixed-wing aircraft arriving HNL east of Waialae Golf Course unless the aircraft advises it is unable radar vectors offshore. Aircraft that are unable to descend in a timely manner due to glide restrictions (e.g., air taxi caravans) and are able offshore vectors must be issued a heading to enter Area D at or above 6,000’ unless otherwise coordinated with H/W. Vector all other fixed-wing aircraft arriving HNL offshore. The heading must be entered into the scratch pad prior to handoff to the appropriate sector.
      2. RWY 8L closed/unusable – Freeway Arrivals authorized.
      3. When VFR aircraft are issued the Freeway Arrival, enter “F (runway #)” into the scratch pad.
5. Provides departure control services to all Class B aircraft departing to the north via the Redhill or West Loch.
6. Vector inter-island arrivals from the southeast for the visual approach to RWY 8L with base leg at the Pearl Harbor Channel with H radar approval.
   1. H radar must approve the visual approach via the channel by entering “8C” in the MEARTS scratch pad of the aircraft concerned.
   2. H radar authorizes V radar control of aircraft upon completion of radar handoff.
7. Provide LA departure release for aircraft unable to comply with the CKH R240 crossing restriction during RWY 4/8 (8L open/available). Inform the appropriate departure controller that the release has been approved with the ACID.
8. Runway closed/unavailable to arrivals.
   1. RWY 8L closed/unavailable - H radar assumes control of RWY 4R sequencing for aircraft from the south. V radar is authorized to sequence to RWY 4L.
   2. RWY 4R closed/unavailable - V radar is authorized to sequence to RWY 4L.
9. During RWY 4/8 "No LAHSO operation" sequence RWY 4R arrivals after and/or between RWY 8L traffic.
10. During RWY 22/26 operations, V radar must ensure VFR aircraft remain over or north of the H1 Freeway.
11. During RWY 4/8, all arrivals must enter the tower's airspace through Area B or Area C north of the shoreline. During RWY 22/26, all arrivals must enter the Tower’s airspace through Area C or through Area B, excluding the departure corridor.

## 5.3 - Helicopter Operations

1. Helicopters inbound from the west interchange must be cleared into Class B airspace to hold at Ford Island.
2. Helicopters inbound from the east/freeway must be cleared into Class B airspace at or below 1,000' to hold at Punchbowl and to expect further clearance from Honolulu Tower.
3. V assumes control of departing helicopters during RWY 22/26 configuration for turns to Ford Island upon frequency change from the Tower.
4. Shoreline arrivals must be permitted for MEDIVAC, Police or Fire department helicopters at or below 300'. Other shoreline arrivals may be permitted with the Tower's approval.
