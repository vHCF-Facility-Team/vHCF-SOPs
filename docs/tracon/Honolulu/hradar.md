## 6.2 - Control Instructions

1. Provide radar services within airspace.
2. Establish approach sequence for RWY 8L and RWY 26L. Effect handoff to V radar for arrivals via the JULLE Star for sequence to RWY 4R or type “8C” in the scratch pad field for V radar to sequence to RWY 8L, traffic conditions permitting.
3. Provide IFR departure control services to IFR aircraft north, west, and southbound from HNL.
4. During RWY 4/8 “no LAHSO operations,” provide at least 7 miles in trail spacing between RWY 8L arrivals to allow V radar to sequence RWY 4R arrivals between the RWY 8L arrivals. “No LAHSO operations” refers to an overall condition caused by equipment, weather, and/or wind. This does not refer to individual aircraft unable to participate in LAHSO.
5. During RWY 8L closure, Honolulu Approach sequence for RWY 4R.
6. Provide departure and approach control services to JRF and HHI. During RWY 22/26 configuration, coordinate via the MEARTS and verbally with the Cab for RWY 22/29 arrivals to JRF.
7. Provides tower to tower radar services between NGF and HNL/JRF/HHI.
8. Establish approach sequence for RWY 4R and/or 8L and 26L as follows:
   1. For arrivals to RWY 26L, ensure that all large twin turbo prop and turbojet aircraft (excluding fighters):
      1. Are at least 5 MIT when the preceding arrival aircraft crosses the runway threshold; At least 7 MIT when Tower advises ADW procedures are being applied.
      2. When Tower advises ADW procedures are being applied, cross HNL VOR 6 DME at no GREATER than 180 knots. There are no specific speed restrictions for in trail aircraft, other than that aircraft shall be at similar speeds to prevent compression to less than the required MIT.
      3. For arrivals via the JULLE STAR:
         1. Effect hand-off to V radar for sequence to RWY 4R.
         2. Aircraft inbound to RWY 8L via the channel must have “8C” entered into the scratch pad field. H may enter “8C” into scratch pad to indicate V radar may sequence to RWY 8L via the channel.
