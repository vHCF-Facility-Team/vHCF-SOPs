## 4.2 - Control Instructions

1. Provide radar services within assigned airspace.
2. Provide departure control services to eastbound IFR departure.
3. Provide departure control services to all eastbound Class B departures.
   1. RWY 4/8 configuration:
      1. Freeway departure.
      3. Shoreline departure.
      4. Punchbowl departure.
   2. RWY 22/26 configuration:
      1. Kona departure.
4. Provide Class B airspace services and/or traffic advisories to VFR aircraft overflying Honolulu from east to west; coordinate with V/H radar as appropriate.
5. Provide initial approach sequencing for aircraft inbound from the east.
6. RWY 22/26 operations. The following will apply unless verbally coordinated:
   1. L must assign all aircraft exiting the Honolulu terminal area via V2 or the NORBY corridor 7,000' or filed altitude, whichever is higher, but no higher than 16,000’.
   2. All aircraft on the KEAHI SID must be direct KEAHI or on a vector to join the HNL138R. Aircraft must be assigned 5,000’ to expect final altitude or whichever is lower. Sector 4 has control for climb for aircraft on the KEAHI SID.
   3. L must sequence arrival as follows, unless AIT is being applied. When AIT is being applied between Sectors 3/L/V/ or H, do not enter scratch pad information. The absence of scratch pad information signifies initial contact from Sector 3.
      1. L must clear small VFR propeller driven aircraft landing HNL from the east to enter Class B airspace via KONA Arrival. “22L” (22R when 22L is closed) must be entered into the scratch pad prior to handoff to V.
      2. L must clear small IFR propeller driven aircraft landing HNL from the east direct to CKH or on a heading which will enter Area D descending to 3,000’. “CKH” or aircraft heading must be entered into the scratch pad prior to handoff to V.
      3. L must clear IFR aircraft inbound to RWY 26L on a heading which will enter Area G maintaining 4,000’. The heading must be entered into the scratch pad prior to handoff to H.
7. RWY 4/8 operations. The following will apply unless verbally coordinated:
   1. Assign jet aircraft on the PALAY SID 13,000' or filed altitude, whichever is lower.
   2. Assign propeller aircraft on the PALAY SID 9,000' or filed altitude, whichever is lower.
   3. L must sequence arrivals as follows, unless AIT is being applied. When AIT is being applied between Sectors 3/L/V or H, do not enter scratch pad information. The absence of scratch pad information signifies initial contact from Sector 3.
      1. 0700-1730 HST – Freeway arrivals or route similar to, not authorized to RWY 4R (RWY 4L when RWY 4R is closed) for fixed-wing aircraft arriving HNL east of Waialae Golf Course unless the aircraft advises it is unable radar vectors offshore. When vectored offshore the heading must be entered into the scratch pad prior to handoff to the appropriate sector or verbally coordinated.
      2. RWY 8L closed/unusable – Freeway Arrivals authorized. When VFR aircraft are issued the Freeway Arrival, enter “F (runway #)” into the scratch pad.
8. Arrival into Honolulu:
   1. L authorizes V/H control of aircraft upon completion of a radar handoff

## 4.3 - Helicopter Operations

1. Helicopters inbound from the east/freeway should be cleared into Class B airspace at or below 1,000' to hold at Punchbowl and expect further clearance from Honolulu Tower.
2. Shoreline arrivals must be permitted for MEDIVAC, Police or Fire department helicopters. Other shoreline arrivals may be permitted with Tower approval.

## 4.4 - Handoffs

1. HCF Sector 3 - 124.100:
    1. MKK SID
    2. PALAY SID, MKK Transition
    3. JRF Departures via MKK VORTAC
    4. JRF Departures via JELIE SID
    5. KOKO HEAD
2. HCF Sector 4 - 119.300:
    1. PALAY SID, LNY Transition
    2. KEAHI SID (RWY 22/26 only)

    4. KOKO HEAD SID, PALAY Transition
3. NGF
    1. Tower – 120.700
    2. Approach – 125.000

## 4.5 - Traffic Flow

1. From HNL Approach:
    1. MKK SID/JRF departures:
       1. Inter-Island departures direct MKK.
       2. ZIGIE, APACK or CLUTS heading 060° to 090°. Scratch pad inputs of headings may be used in-lieu of verbal coordination if other than a 060°.
       3. EBBER direct EBBER.
       4. PULPS, FITES, SAYTO direct MKK.
       5. Climbing to 16,000’ or lower assigned altitude.
    2. RWY 4/8 departures - PALAY SID/V2:
       1. Jets climbing to 13,000' or filed altitude, whichever is lower.
       2. Props climbing to 9,000' or filed altitude, whichever is lower.
    3. RWY 22/26 departures:
       1. PALAY SID/V2, all aircraft climbing to 7,000' or filed altitude, no higher than 16,000’.
       2. KEAHI SID, all aircraft climbing to 5,000'.
    4. JRF departures direct PALAY, JELIE SID or radar vectors to join V2 prior to exiting the HNL TAB. Assign the same altitudes as above.
    5. HHI departures via the KOKO HEAD SID, climbing to 16,000’or assigned altitude, whichever is lower.
2. To HNL Approach:
    1. HNL arrivals cross LOKIE at 4,000.’
    2. HHI arrivals V8 HNL direct HHI; cross LOKIE at 6,000.’
    3. HCF Center Sector 3 can enter the Honolulu Terminal Area Holding Pattern Airspace Area (HPASA) with aircraft that have been issued holding instructions and have an associated full data block at LOKIE prior to a radar handoff completion.
