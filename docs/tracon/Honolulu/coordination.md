# 9. Coordination

## 9.1 - Prearranged Coordination

1. Prearranged Coordination (P-ACP) is authorized for the following sectors during RWY 4/8 configuration:
    1. H may penetrate L in Areas D, E, & F with HNL departures. L is responsible for separation from departures with arriving aircraft. V assumes separation responsibility after transfer of communications.
    2. H may penetrate V in Area I.
    3. H may penetrate V in Area A with HNL arrivals and HHI arrivals/departures.
    4. H may penetrate L in Areas D with arriving aircraft over or north of IWOHI. V assumes this P-ACP upon completion of a radar handoff.
    5. V may penetrate Tower in Areas B and C with VFR aircraft transitioning over or north of the Freeway at or above 2,000’. Tower is responsible for separation excluding aircraft conducting an overhead/tactical overhead approach.
    6. V may penetrate Tower in Area B north of HNL with VFR aircraft holding at or descending to Ford Island.
    7. V may penetrate L in Areas D & E with arriving aircraft in Area F up to, but not over the airspace boundary line of Area F and with aircraft in Area I on a westerly heading to achieve boundary separation. (When RWY 8L is closed H assumes this PACP and separation responsibility).
    8. H may penetrate Tower in Area C with aircraft over or north of IWOHI, then up to but not over the airspace boundary line of Area C. V assumes this P-ACP upon completion of a radar handoff.
    9. H may penetrate Tower in Area C with aircraft on the Koko Head SID. L assumes this P-ACP upon completion of a radar handoff.
2. Prearranged Coordination (P-ACP) is authorized for the following sectors during RWY 22/26 configuration:
    1. H may penetrate L in Areas H and I with HNL departure and JRF departures/arrivals (L is responsible for separation from departures with arriving aircraft).
    2. H may penetrate V in Area D with arriving aircraft. V must ensure aircraft remain over or north of the H1 Freeway. H is responsible for separation from V until the H aircraft is over or south of the RWY 26L LDA, then V becomes responsible for separation from that traffic. H must coordinate (verbally or through scratch pad) with V aircraft conducting RNAV (RNP) RWY 26L Approach.
    3. H may penetrate V in Area A with HHI arrivals/departures.
    4. V may penetrate Tower in Areas B and C with aircraft transitioning over or north of the Freeway at or above 2,000’.
