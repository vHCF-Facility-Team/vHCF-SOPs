# 5. Arrival Procedures/STAR Descents

## 5.1 - Descent from Enroute

1. The following Descent Instructions will be assigned from ENROUTE and can be the expected Entry Altitudes for aircraft entering the TRACON.
2. If deviations from these Entry Altitudes are required, TRACON can expect coordination from HCF Center.

| STAR Name | Routing |
|:---:|:---|
| INOYI# | Descend Via |
| SYMIN# | Descend Via |
| MAKAH# | Descend Via |
| SHLAE# | Descend Via |
| KLANI# | Descend Via |
| KAENA# | Descend Via |
| MAGGI# | **East**: BAMBO @ 12,000; **West**: BAMBO @ 8,000 |
| JULLE# | JULLE @ 10,000 |
| SAKKI# | SAKKI @ 6,000 |
| OPACA# | **East**: OPACA @ 6,000; **West**: OPACA @ 10,000 |
| BOOKE# | **East**: BOOKE @ 6,000; **West**: BOOKE @ 10,000 |

## 5.2 - Runway/Approach Assignments

1. The initial TRACON controller will assign a Runway/Approach to expect.
2. Different runways can be assigned with coordination.
3. Standard approach during West Ops is LDA.
4. During the hours of 0700-1900 HST (1700-0500Z), turbojet aircraft should be sequenced to runway 8L except when operational necessity closes the runway.
5. During the hours 1900-0700 HST (0500-1700Z), turbojet aircraft should be sequenced to runway 4R, large aircraft may be sequenced to 8L with a base leg at Pearl Harbor Channel but must make such a request and are to be advised that the runway is noise sensitive.
