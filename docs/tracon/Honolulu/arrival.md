# 8. Arrival Procedures/STAR Descents

## 8.1 - Descent from Enroute

1. The following Descent Instructions will be assigned from ENROUTE and can be the expected Entry Altitudes for aircraft entering the TRACON.
2. If deviations from these Entry Altitudes are required, TRACON can expect coordination from HCF Center.

| STAR Name | Routing |
|:---:|:---|
| INOYI# | Descend Via |
| SYMIN# | Descend Via |
| MAKAH# | Descend Via |
| SHLAE# | Descend Via |
| KLANI# | Descend Via |
| KAENA# | Descend Via |
| MAGGI# | **East**: BAMBO @ 12,000; **West**: BAMBO @ 8,000 |
| JULLE# | JULLE @ 10,000 |
| SAKKI# | SAKKI @ 6,000 |
| OPACA# | **East**: OPACA @ 6,000; **West**: OPACA @ 10,000 |
| BOOKE# | **East**: BOOKE @ 6,000; **West**: BOOKE @ 10,000 |

## 8.2 - Runway/Approach Assignments

1. The initial TRACON controller will assign a Runway/Approach to expect.
2. Different runways can be assigned with coordination.
3. Standard approach during West Ops is LDA.
4. Arrivals, RWY 4/8 Configuration.
   1. During the hours of 0700-1900 HST, turbojet aircraft should be sequenced to RWY 8L except for controller/pilot operational necessity/closures/equipment outages. Arrivals must be 5 miles in trail at the threshold inclusive of the Channel approach.
   2. During the hours of 1900-0700 HST, turbojet aircraft should be sequenced to RWY 4R except for operational necessity/closures/equipment outages. Requests for RWY 8L will be advised that the runway is noise sensitive.
   3. During the hours 0630-2200 HST, large aircraft may be sequenced to RWY 8L with a base-leg at the Pearl Harbor Channel.
   4. Overhead approaches to RWY 4R must have prior approval by Tower.
5. Arrivals, RWY 22/26 Configuration. All IFR traffic must be sequenced to RWY 26L excluding small aircraft inbound to RWY 22L. If an operational necessity exists (e.g., to accommodate a RWY 26L or 22L departure, coordination may be completed to change a small/large aircraft to RWY 26R).
6. Approach must sequence all VFR arrival routes (e.g., North, Freeway, West, or Tripler) with straight in traffic to their assigned runway.
7. Tower will retain the option to change an aircraft to RWY 4L. During RWY 22/26, Tower retains the option to change an aircraft to RWY 22R.
8. IFR aircraft are not authorized on VFR arrival routes (Freeway, North, West or Tripler). Aircraft must be advised to expect vectors offshore to RWY 4R.

## 8.3 - Arrival Flow Procedures

1. As deemed necessary by the TRACON or TMU, Flow control will be implemented as needed. This includes taking the following actions(s) as appropriate:
   1. Suspend jet arrivals to Runway 4R or increase the MIT.
   2. Increase MIT to Runway 8L.
   3. Approve/disapprove practice approaches to Honolulu International.

## 8.4 - Handoffs to LC

1. RWY 4/8 configuration when LC2 is open:
   1. RWY 8L, 4L and 4R arrivals shall be switched to LC1 (118.1).
   2. RWY 8R arrivals shall be switched to LC2 (123.9).
2. RWY 22/26 configuration when LC2 is open:
   1. RWY 26R, 22R and 22L arrivals shall be switched to LC1 (118.1).
   2. RWY 26L arrivals shall be switched to LC2 (123.9).
