## 3.1 - Airspace

1. Provide air traffic control service up to and including 16,000 feet.

## 3.2 - Sectorization

1. The primary “combined” radar position shall be Honolulu East Approach (HE). No other sectors should be staffed until the “combined” position is already in use.
2. Once HE is in use, HE may delegate a portion of its airspace to Honolulu West Approach (HW).
3. During East Ops:
   1. HE will handle all departures and feed aircraft to HW.
   2. HW will be the final sector for all arrivals into HNL.
4. During West Ops:
   1. HW will handle all departures and feed aircraft to HE.
   2. HE will be the final sector for all arrivals into HNL.
5. No matter the Ops at HNL, each sector will be responsible for the satellite fields within their designated airspace.

## 3.3 - Departure Releases

1. Unless otherwise coordinated, ALL AIRPORTS within HNL TRACON shall request departure releases from HNL TRACON for all IFR departures.
2. Upon receipt of the departure release, the release shall remain valid for five (5) consecutive minutes.
3. Departure Releases AND rolling calls will include the following content:
    1. Aircraft Callsign
    2. SID or Initial Waypoint

   2. Advise aircraft on a visual missed approach in West ops to fly heading 180, climb and maintain 4,000ft and expect vectors to final approach course by contacting TRACON.
   3. Advise aircraft on an instrument approach to fly the published missed approach and to contact TRACON.
2. **PHJR (Kalaeloa Airport - John Rogers Field)**
