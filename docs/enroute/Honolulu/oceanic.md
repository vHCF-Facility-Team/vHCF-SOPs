# 5. Oceanic Procedures

## 5.1 - Procedure if Oceanic Online

1. When ZAK_E_FSS is online, HCF is responsible for obtaining an Oceanic Clearance at least 20 minutes prior to TCP (Transfer Control Point) for aircraft filing oceanic routes, including Oceanic enroute traffic arriving in HCF airspace and returning to Oceanic Airspace. Since the FSS is not a radar position, do not use the radar client handoff feature to turn aircraft over to the FSS. The FSS needs no interphone call, if no special conditions exist and the aircraft is within five minutes of the estimated TCP time. Just issue the frequency change to the aircraft. Specifically, the fol-lowing actions should be taken to transfer control of the aircraft:
   1. Contact FSS by private message (viewable in Controller and chat window).
   2. The request for clearance shall consist of the callsign, TCP fix or route number, cruise altitude, and estimated time the flight will reach the TCP fix or FIR boundary. Example: "Hawaiian 2323 arrives R465 CIVIT 1813z FL350".
   3. Advise the aircraft they are leaving HCF airspace. Issue a beacon code of 2000, terminate radar services and contact San Francisco radio on 131.950.
2. The clearance approval shall consist of the callsign and the controller's operating initials. Option-ally include a clearance time, if needed to delay arrival onto the oceanic track. The HCF shall then sequence control and turnover of the flight so as not to arrive before the clearance time.
3. If the flight's estimated time of control turnover should become earlier or more than 5 minutes different from the clearance time, HCF must obtain a revised clearance.

## 5.2 - Oceanic to HCF

1. The FSS will notify HCF of all aircraft exiting the Oceanic FSS with an estimated time of control transfer. Control transfer shall occur at least 15 minutes prior to the aircraft passing the TCP. HCF may request earlier control transfer as long as the aircraft is radar identified (e.g.: "AAL1028, re-quest control"), and this may be granted conditions permitting.
2. The HCF may pass a beacon code to the FSS to be passed to the aircraft to facilitate radar iden-tification.
3. VFR flights may be conducted in the airspace surrounding Pacific Islands within the ZAK FIR: Between sunrise and sunset When operating less than 100 nm from any landmass, below FL200. VFR flight is otherwise prohibited in Oceanic Class A airspace.

## 5.3 - Procedure if Oceanic Offline

When Oceanic FSS is offline, advise aircraft “Radar services terminated, squawk 2000, frequency change approved”.
