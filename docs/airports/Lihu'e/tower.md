# 3. Local Control

## 3.1 - Responsibilities

1. LC is responsible for all aircraft operating in the class “D” airspace.
2. LC is responsible for selecting the active runways based on the weather conditions.
3. LC must communicate runway changes with the appropriate Center Controller as well as GC and must ensure that all controllers are ready for the switch.
4. LC shall not start radar track on any aircraft, Lihu’e Tower is not a radar equipped tower.

## 3.2 - Departure Procedures

1. LC shall provide proper spacing to all aircraft in the Lihu’e class “D” airspace.
2. Departure releases are not required at Lihu’e, unless sector HNL_02_CTR is on frequency during an event or other busy time period at HCF. Center may request releases or rolling releases from LC.
3. LC shall transfer communication to HCF Center as soon as feasible after departure.
4. VFR departures remaining within the class “D” airspace shall remain on the tower frequency.
5. **Runway headings:**
    1. IFR departures with no SID shall be assigned runway heading for all runways.
    2. IFR departures on the LIHUE# or RICHE# will be instructed to fly the SID after takeoff.
6. **Diverse Vector Area (DVA)**
    1. RWY 3: 020° CW 160° out to 20 NM
    2. RWY 21: Right turn to heading 030° *May be used only during RWY 17/21 operations and when RWY 17/35 is closed.
    3. RWY 17: 360° CW 150° out to 20 NM
    4. RWY 35: 020° CW 165° out to 20 NM

## 3.3 - Arrival Procedures

1. LC is responsible for proper separation of all aircraft under their control.
2. LC shall provide VFR aircraft with entry instructions into the pattern.

## 3.4 - Missed Approaches/Go-Arounds

1. Advise aircraft on an **instrument** approach to fly the published missed approach and to contact HNL_02_CTR.
2. Advise aircraft on a **visual** approach fly runway heading, climb and maintain 4,000ft and contact HNL_02_CTR.
3. Alternatively, the following vectors can be given:
    1. RWY 3: Authorized headings 020 CW 160. No prominent obstacles.
    2. RWY 17: Authorized headings 360 CW 150. No prominent obstacles.
    3. RWY 35: Authorized headings 020 CW 168. No prominent obstacles.

## 3.5 - Closed Traffic

1. VFR aircraft may operate in the pattern at or below 1,500 feet.
2. Runway 17 and 21 shall utilize left closed traffic.
3. Runway 03 and 35 shall utilize right closed traffic.

## 3.6 - Opposite Direction Operations

1. Scope. These procedures apply to same runway ODO at LIH between an:
    1. Arrival and a departure
    2. Arrival and an arrival
2. Definition. Opposite Direction Operations: IFR/VFR Operations conducted to the same or par-allel runway where an aircraft is operating in a reciprocal direction of another aircraft arriving, departing, or conducting an approach. For the purposes here, operations to converging runways 03/21 and 35/17 will be recognized as the “same runway”.
    1. (Example: Departure off Runway 3 and Arrival to Runway 17, Departure off Runway 35 and Arrival to Runway 21).
    2. Aircraft requesting a circling approach and are on an arrival course operating in a reciprocal direction of another aircraft arriving, departing, or conducting an approach will be treated as an ODO operation.
3. Responsibilities.
    1. Local Control and Approach share the responsibilities to coordinate ODO and issue traffic advisories.
    2. ODO between IFR aircraft will be conducted at the discretion of HCF. Release instructions issued by HCF provide non-radar, opposite direction separation.
    3. HCF is responsible for application of cutoff points involving ODO procedures between IFR aircraft.
4. General
    1. These procedures are applicable only when HCF radar is operational.
    2. ODO procedures are applicable when two aircraft will execute approaches to opposite ends of the same runway, or an aircraft will depart prior to an arrival on an opposite direction approach to the same runway.
    3. Traffic advisories must be issues to both aircraft
        1. Example - “OPPOSITE DIRECTION TRAFFIC (distance) MILE FINAL, (type aircraft).”; “OPPOSITE DIRECTION TRAFFIC DEPARTING RUNWAY (number), (type aircraft).”; “OPPOSITE DIRECTION TRAFFIC (position), (type aircraft).”
    4. Opposite direction same runway operations with opposing traffic inside the cutoff point is not allowed unless an emergency situation exists.
    5. Use of visual separation is not authorized for aircraft receiving IFR services that are con-ducting ODO to the same runway.
5. Procedures for aircraft receiving IFR services:
    1. Coordination
        1. LC and Approach are responsible for initiating coordination required to accomplish an opposite direction arrival or departure.
        2. Tower must verbally request opposite direction departures with TRACON.
        3. Approach must verbally request opposite direction arrivals with Tower.
    2. Cutoff Procedures: For aircraft receiving IFR services and conducting opposite direction same runway operations:
        1. IFR Departure / IFR Arrival:
            1. A departing aircraft, including a practice approach aircraft performing a touch-and-go or stop-and-go, must be airborne and established in a turn to a heading of 080° to avoid conflict prior to an aircraft reaching a point **15** flying miles from the threshold of the runway of intended landing.
            2. An aircraft performing a go-around, low approach or missed approach must be issued a turn to a heading of 080°, climb to 4,000 feet MSL to avoid conflict prior to an arrival aircraft reaching a point **15** flying miles from the threshold of the runway of intended landing.
            3. If an arrival crosses the cutoff point too soon, HCF must issue instructions to discontinue the approach and issue a turn away from the departure in an effort to protect the integrity of the cutoff point.
        2. IFR Arrival / IFR Arrival
            1. An arriving aircraft must cross the runway threshold prior to the subse-quent arrival reaching a point **15** flying miles from the threshold of the runway of intended landing.
            2. If the first arrival advises LC of a need to conduct a missed approach, the Tower must issue the aircraft a heading of 080°, climb to 4,000 feet MSL.
            3. If the (ODO) arrival crosses the cutoff point too soon, HCF must issue control instructions to protect the integrity of the cutoff point.
6. Procedures for VFR/VFR and VFR/IFR Operations:
    1. HCF and LC must issue traffic to both aircraft and indicate the direction that the departure will turn (arrival vs departure) or the location of the opposing aircraft on final (arrival vs arrival).
    2. LC will ensure VFR aircraft are issued a turn to avoid conflict with opposing IFR/VFR traffic.
    3. All coordination must contain the phrase “OPPOSITE DIRECTION”.
