## 2 - Runway Configurations

### 2.1 - General

1. Aircraft will not land or depart on runways with a 10 knots or greater tailwind component, unless the pilot requests to do so and is operationally ok.
2. All heavy and/or large four-engine turbo engine jet aircraft must depart on 8R, 26R, 22L or 26L, except aircraft bound for an Outer Island may depart runway 8L. LC may depart narrow body/small aircraft on 8L, 4L or 4R.
3. Do not authorize turbojet/large four-engine propeller driven aircraft to depart runway 4R or 4L, except: during daylight hours only, turbojet aircraft with gross take-off weight less than 22,000 pounds may depart runway 4R. Instruct aircraft to execute a right turn to their assigned departure heading prior to runway 8L.
4. The calm wind operation is East Ops.

### 2.2 - Change in Runway Configuration

1. The CIC must determine the need for making any runway change. A routine runway change oc-curs when traffic and/or weather conditions are such that the change can be made with little or no degradation in service. In this instance, departures are allowed to depart from the runway originally assigned. Use the following procedures to complete a routine runway change
   1. Provide Approach with the last departure’s identification, its estimated time of departure, and the departure runway.
   2. Once the last aircraft departs, ensure no other aircraft departs HNL without a release from Approach.
   3. Ensure that departures off the new runway have received the appropriate departure con-trol frequency and departure heading (if given by Clearance), as needed.
   4. Approach shall inform the CIC when the sector reconfiguration has been completed.
   5. Ensure the ATIS has been updated and reflects the proper status.

### 2.3 - East Ops

1. Departure and Arrival runways are 8L, 8R and 4R.
2. Heavy Aircraft must depart runway 8R.
3. Assign and taxi all large Twin Turbo prop aircraft from the North Ramp to RWY 8R for departure
4. Assign and taxi all twin prop and smaller aircraft from the south ramp to RWY 4R/4L TWY F for departure.

### 2.4 - West Ops

1. Arrival Runways are 26L and 22L.
2. Departure Runways are 26R and 22L.
3. This configuration should be chosen if the weather is in such a condition that East Ops is not viable anymore, see 2.1.1 for reference.

### 2.5 - Event Ops

1. Runways 4/8: All large aircraft and above (inclusive of turboprops) must be taxied to Runway 8R.
2. Runways 22/26: All large aircraft and above (inclusive of turboprops) must be taxied to Runway 26R unless operational requirements require Runway 22L or Runway 26L (i.e., F22 to Runway 22L)

## 3 - Clearance Delivery

### 3.1 - Departure Instructions

1. Initial altitude for all IFR Aircraft shall be 5,000 feet.
2. VFR aircraft remaining in the pattern shall receive clearance INTO the Bravo airspace at altitude of 1,500 or below.
3. VFR aircraft departing the Class Bravo shall receive clearance OUT of the Bravo airspace and maintain VFR at or below 3000.
   1. VFR Helicopter see below.
4. VFR aircraft not remaining with the pattern and requesting flight following will be given the appropriate departure frequency

### 3.2 - Departure Headings

## 4 - Ground Control

### 4.1 - General

1. GC is responsible for the movement of all aircraft on the movement area to and from the runways.
2. GC has control of all taxiways with the exception of taxiways between runway 04L and 04R, 22R and 22L, and Taxiway C between 04R/22L and 8L/26R.
3. GC shall ensure pilots have the current ATIS.
4. GC shall ensure that aircraft are squawking Mode Charlie and their assigned beacon code prior to re-ceiving taxi clearance.
5. GC shall respond to aircraft as first come first served. This does not include sequencing aircraft or any TMU restrictions.
6. Taxiway P closed to aircraft over 12,500 lbs.
7. Aircraft on taxiway R must be held short of the appropriate hold line for conflicting traffic on approach to either runway 4L or 4R. During runway 22/26 configuration, only ADG V and above aircraft must be held short of the appropriate hold line for traffic departing runway 22L/22R
8. Do not allow aircraft larger than a B737/B717 to make a 180 degree turn on taxiway A west of taxiway A1. This restriction also applies to taxiways V and T north of RWY 8L.

### 4.2 - Standardized Taxi Routings

1. East Ops:
   1. Taxiway G northbound to Terminal 1, Taxiway L southbound
   2. Taxiway V northbound to Hickam Ramp, Taxiway T southbound
2. West Ops:
   1. Taxiway L northbound to Terminal 1, Taxiway G southbound
   2. Taxiway T northbound to Hickam Ramp, Taxiway V southbound

### 4.3 - Pushback Procedures

1. When an aircraft calls ground control requesting pushback instructions from a non-movement area, and the aircraft will remain in a non-movement area, include the phraseology “at pilot’s discretion”
   1. EXAMPLE – DAL21 pushback at pilot’s discretion. Remain clear of TWY Z.
2. When an aircraft calls ground control requesting pushback instructions and the aircraft will enter a movement are, i.e., taxiway, issue authorization on the taxiway/movement area.
   1. EXAMPLE – DAL21 pushback on TWY Z. Tail/Face east
   2. EXAMPLE – DAL21 pushback on TWY Z approved. Tail/Face east
3. If Ramp Control is online, they will handle the startups and pushbacks inside the non-movement areas. Gates that need a pushback clearance into a movement area are still GC responsibility.

### 4.4 - Operations when Local Control is split

1. Instruct all aircraft taxiing to RWY 8R from the south ramp to hold short of RWY 4R approach and monitor tower on 118.1
2. When aircraft from the North ramp require RWY 26L (22/26 configuration) for departure due to operational necessity GC taxi the aircraft to hold short of RWY 26R at TWY D and advise aircraft to monitor tower on 118.1.
3. Deliver all full flight progress strips as designated (RWY 4/8)
   1. RWY 8R departure, pass flight progress strip to LC2
   2. RWY 8R departure from the south ramp, pass flight progress strip to LC2,
   3. Pass all military flight plans to LC 1 that will be outbound on TWY T or M.
   4. Pass all flight progress strips for aircraft taxing from the Hickam AMC (outbound at A1 -A4) ramp to LC2.
   5. Pass all helicopters (and float planes) flight progress strips departing on the Shoreline departure to LC2. All other helicopters and VFR departure route fixed wing aircraft will be passed to LC1.
   6. NOTE: Shoreline departures for fixed wing aircraft, except for float planes, are not authorized when LC1 and LC2 are de-combined.
4. Deliver all flight progress strips as designated (RWY 22/26)
   1. Pass all RWY 26R, 22L, 22R departure flight progress strips to LC1.
