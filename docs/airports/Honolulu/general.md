## 1.2 - Runway Configurations

### 1.2.1 - General

1. Aircraft will not land or depart on runways with a 10 knots or greater tailwind component, unless the pilot requests to do so and is operationally ok.
2. All heavy and/or large four-engine turbo engine jet aircraft must depart on 8R, 26R, 22L or 26L, except aircraft bound for an Outer Island may depart runway 8L. LC may depart narrow body/small aircraft on 8L, 4L or 4R.
3. Do not authorize turbojet/large four-engine propeller driven aircraft to depart runway 4R or 4L, except: during daylight hours only, turbojet aircraft with gross take-off weight less than 22,000 pounds may depart runway 4R. Instruct aircraft to execute a right turn to their assigned departure heading prior to runway 8L.
4. The calm wind operation is East Ops.

### 1.2.2 - Change in Runway Configuration

1. The CIC must determine the need for making any runway change. A routine runway change oc-curs when traffic and/or weather conditions are such that the change can be made with little or no degradation in service. In this instance, departures are allowed to depart from the runway originally assigned. Use the following procedures to complete a routine runway change
   1. Provide Approach with the last departure’s identification, its estimated time of departure, and the departure runway.
   2. Once the last aircraft departs, ensure no other aircraft departs HNL without a release from Approach.
   3. Ensure that departures off the new runway have received the appropriate departure con-trol frequency and departure heading (if given by Clearance), as needed.
   4. Approach shall inform the CIC when the sector reconfiguration has been completed.
   5. Ensure the ATIS has been updated and reflects the proper status.

### 1.2.3 - General Runway Use

1. RWY 4L/22R is a B-III runway. Aircraft are restricted to Approach Category B (<121 kts) and ADG III (wingspan <118 feet and tail height < 45 feet), e.g., AT72, DH8D.
2. Arrivals RWY 4/8 Configuration between 0700-1900 HST:
   1. To the maximum extent possible, all large turbojet aircraft and larger must be sequenced to RWY 8L.
   2. Arrivals to RWY 8L must be at least 5 MIT, constant or increasing.
3. Arrivals RWY 4/8 Configuration all hours:
   1. Full LAHSO. Arrivals to RWY 4R:
      1. When the successive aircraft is a jet, provide at least 5 MIT, constant or increasing.
      2. When the successive aircraft is a prop, provide at least 3 MIT, constant or increasing.
   2. RWY 8L Closed and No LAHSO in effect. Arrivals to RWY 4R/4L:
      1. When the successive aircraft is a jet, provide at least 7 MIT, constant or increasing.
      2. When the successive aircraft is a prop, provide at least 3 MIT, constant or increasing.
   3. All VFR arrival routes and straight-in arrivals must be sequenced by Approach to their assigned runway.
4. RWY 4/8 Configuration between 0900-1500 HST:
   1. Assign and taxi all large Twin Turbo prop aircraft from the North ramp to RWY 8R for departure.
   2. Assign and taxi all twin prop and smaller aircraft from the south ramp to RWY 4R at TWY F for departure.
5. Arrivals RWY 22/26 Configuration between 0700-1900 HST:
   1. All offshore arrivals on the RWY 26L final (to include the LDA, RNAV, visual, etc.) expect RWY 26L.
   2. All VFR arrival routes and Charted Visual approaches are to RWY 22L except:
      1. When RWY 22L is closed/unavailable, small propeller driven aircraft sequenced to RWY 22R.
      2. When RWY 26R is unavailable to departures full length, small propeller driven aircraft sequenced to RWY 22R.
6. All heavy and/or large four-engine turbojet aircraft must depart RWY 8R, 26R, 22L or 26L, except heavy air carrier aircraft bound for an Outer Island may depart RWY 8L.
7. Aircraft requiring departures on RWY 8L due to operational necessity must obtain authorization from Tower and be able to turn initial heading before the end of runway.
8. Do not authorize turbojet/large four-engine propeller driven aircraft to depart RWY 4R or 4L, except: during daylight hours only, turbojet aircraft with gross take-off weight less than 22,000 pounds may depart RWY 4R. Instruct aircraft to execute a right turn to their assigned departure heading prior to RWY 8L.
9. Between the hours of 0900-1500 HST:
   1.  RWY 4/8 – All large aircraft and above (inclusive of turboprops) must be taxied to RWY 8R.
   2.  RWY 22/26 – All large aircraft and above (inclusive of turboprops) must be taxied to RWY 26R unless operational requirements require RWY 22L or RWY 26L (i.e., F22 to RWY 22L).
