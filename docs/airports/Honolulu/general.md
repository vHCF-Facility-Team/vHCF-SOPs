## 1.2 - Runway Configurations

### 1.2.1 - General

1. Aircraft will not land or depart on runways with a 10 knots or greater tailwind component, unless the pilot requests to do so and is operationally ok.
2. All heavy and/or large four-engine turbo engine jet aircraft must depart on 8R, 26R, 22L or 26L, except aircraft bound for an Outer Island may depart runway 8L. LC may depart narrow body/small aircraft on 8L, 4L or 4R.
3. Do not authorize turbojet/large four-engine propeller driven aircraft to depart runway 4R or 4L, except: during daylight hours only, turbojet aircraft with gross take-off weight less than 22,000 pounds may depart runway 4R. Instruct aircraft to execute a right turn to their assigned departure heading prior to runway 8L.
4. The calm wind operation is East Ops.

### 1.2.2 - Change in Runway Configuration

1. The CIC must determine the need for making any runway change. A routine runway change oc-curs when traffic and/or weather conditions are such that the change can be made with little or no degradation in service. In this instance, departures are allowed to depart from the runway originally assigned. Use the following procedures to complete a routine runway change
   1. Provide Approach with the last departureâ€™s identification, its estimated time of departure, and the departure runway.
   2. Once the last aircraft departs, ensure no other aircraft departs HNL without a release from Approach.
   3. Ensure that departures off the new runway have received the appropriate departure con-trol frequency and departure heading (if given by Clearance), as needed.
   4. Approach shall inform the CIC when the sector reconfiguration has been completed.
   5. Ensure the ATIS has been updated and reflects the proper status.

### 1.2.3 - East Ops

1. Departure and Arrival runways are 8L, 8R and 4R.
2. Heavy Aircraft must depart runway 8R.
3. Assign and taxi all large Twin Turbo prop aircraft from the North Ramp to RWY 8R for departure
4. Assign and taxi all twin prop and smaller aircraft from the south ramp to RWY 4R/4L TWY F for departure.

### 1.2.4 - West Ops

1. Arrival Runways are 26L and 22L.
2. Departure Runways are 26R and 22L.
3. This configuration should be chosen if the weather is in such a condition that East Ops is not viable anymore, see 2.1.1 for reference.

### 1.2.5 - Event Ops

1. Runways 4/8: All large aircraft and above (inclusive of turboprops) must be taxied to Runway 8R.
2. Runways 22/26: All large aircraft and above (inclusive of turboprops) must be taxied to Runway 26R unless operational requirements require Runway 22L or Runway 26L (i.e., F22 to Runway 22L)
