# 6. Opposite Direction Operations (ODO)

These procedures apply to same RWY (8L/26R, 8R/26L, 4L/22R, 4R/22L) and parallel runway ODO at Honolulu between an arrival and a departure and an arrival and an arrival.

1. Definition. Opposite Direction Operations are IFR/VFR operations conducted to the same or parallel runways where an aircraft is operating in a reciprocal direction of another aircraft arriving, departing, or conducting an approach.
2. Responsibilities.
    1. Approach Control and Tower share the responsibilities to coordinate ODO and issue traffic advisories as herein prescribed.
    2. Local Control is responsible to apply the cutoff point(s) between ODO arriving and departing aircraft IAW paragraph 3.3.
    3. Approach Control H position is responsible to apply the cutoff point(s) between successive ODO arrivals IAW paragraph 3.3.
    4. A turn away from ODO traffic must ensure appropriate lateral separation.
3. Procedures for Aircraft Receiving IFR Services.
    1. General.
        1. These procedures are applicable only when Approach Control radar is operational.
        2. When the Tower’s Radar Display is out of service, Approach Control will be responsible to ensure all (arrival and departure) cutoff points are met.
        3. ODO procedures are applicable when two aircraft will execute approaches to opposite ends of the same runway, or an aircraft will depart prior to an arrival on an opposite direction approach to the same or parallel runway.
        4. Traffic advisories must be issued to both arriving and departing aircraft.
            1. **EXAMPLE:** 
            2. “Opposite direction traffic (distance) mile final, (type aircraft).”
            3. “Opposite direction traffic departing runway (number), (type aircraft).”
            4. “Opposite direction traffic (position), (type aircraft).”
        5. Do not allow opposite direction same runway operations with opposing traffic inside the cutoff point unless an emergency situation exists.
        6. Do not allow opposite direction practice approaches, except in the case of Flight Check, cutoff points in paragraph 3.3 must be applied.
        7. Use of visual separation is not authorized for aircraft receiving IFR services that are conducting ODO to the SAME runway.
        8. When conducting an opposite direction circling maneuver, the aircraft is no longer considered an ODO when the provisions of FAA JO 7110.65, paragraph 5-5-7, Passing or Diverging, may be applied.
        9. Parallel Runway Operations. IFR aircraft conducting ODO to parallel RWY 4/22 and 8/26:
            1. Ensure that a turn away from opposing traffic is issued to provide appropriate lateral separation.
            2. Use of visual separation is authorized once a turn away from opposing traffic is issued.
            3. Traffic advisories must be issued to both aircraft.
    2. Coordination.
        1. Local Assist/or Local Control must verbally request opposite direction departures with Approach Control.
        2. Approach Control must verbally request opposite direction arrivals with Local Assist/or Local Control.
        3. All coordination must be accomplished on a recorded line and must contain the phrase “OPPOSITE DIRECTION.” Initial coordination must also include the call sign, aircraft type and departure or arrival runway.
    3. Cutoff Procedures. For aircraft receiving IFR services and conducting ODO:
        1. Departure vs Arrival (SAME Runway). A departing aircraft must be airborne and issued a turn to avoid conflict prior to an arriving aircraft reaching:
            1. A point 14 flying miles from the threshold of the runway of intended landing, when either the arriving or departing aircraft is a turbojet or turboprop: or
            2. A point ten 10 flying miles from the threshold of the runway of intended landing for all other aircraft.
            3. If the above condition are not met, action must be taken to ensure control instructions are issued to protect the integrity of the cut off points.
            4. An aircraft performing a low approach, touch-and-go, stop-and-go, or missed approach must be considered a departure at the threshold.
        2. Departure vs Arrival (PARALLEL Runway). A departing aircraft must be airborne and issued a turn to avoid conflict prior to an arriving aircraft reaching:
            1. A point 14 flying miles from the threshold of the runway of intended landing, when either the arriving or departing aircraft is a turbojet or turboprop: or
            2. A point ten 10 flying miles from the threshold of the runway of intended landing for all other aircraft.
            3. If the above conditions are not met, action must be taken to ensure control instructions are issued to protect the integrity of the cut off points.
            4. An aircraft performing a low approach, touch-and-go, stop-and-go, or missed approach must be considered a departure at the threshold.
            5. The following combinations of ODO Arrival vs Departure using parallel runways is NOT authorized.
                1. Departure RWY 8R / Arrival RWY 26R.
                2. Departure RWY 26R / Arrival RWY 8R.
        3. Arrival vs Arrival (SAME runway). An arriving aircraft must cross the runway threshold prior to the following ODO arriving aircraft reaching.
            1. A point 5 flying miles from the threshold of the runway of intended landing regardless of aircraft type; or
            2. If an aircraft is established in the traffic pattern, prior to the second arriving aircraft turning base leg.
            3. If the above conditions are not met, action must be taken to ensure control instructions are issued to protect the integrity of the cut off points.
        4. Arrival vs Arrival (Parallel RWY 8R/26L vs 8L/26R) No ODO cutoff requirement.
    4. Procedures for VFR/VFR and VFR/IFR Operations:
        1. Ensure VFR aircraft are issued a turn to avoid conflict with opposing IFR/VFR traffic.
        2. If coordination with another position is required, LC must state the phrase “Opposite Direction.”
        3. LC must issue traffic to both aircraft and indicate the direction that the departure will turn (arrival/departure) or the location of the opposing aircraft on final (arrival/arrival).
