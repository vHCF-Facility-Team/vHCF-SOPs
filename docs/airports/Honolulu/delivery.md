# 2. Clearance Delivery

## 2.1 - Departure Instructions

1. Initial altitude for all IFR Aircraft shall be 5,000 feet.

### 2.1.1 - VFR Departure Instructions

1. VFR aircraft remaining in the pattern shall receive clearance INTO the Bravo airspace at altitude of 1,500 or below.
2. VFR aircraft departing the Class Bravo shall receive clearance OUT of the Bravo airspace and maintain VFR at or below 3000.
    1. VFR Helicopter see below.
3. VFR aircraft not remaining with the pattern and requesting flight following will be given the appropriate departure frequency
4. During RWY 4/8 configuration, assign the following:
    1. Shoreline Departure. Except for float planes departing the sealanes, the Shoreline departure is not available for fixed wing aircraft when LC2 is decombined.
    2. Freeway Departure – This departure is intended for use by single engine aircraft during daylight hours only.
    3. Redhill Departure.
    4. Punchbowl Departure – When LC2 is decombined, this departure is intended for use by twin engine and high-performance single engine aircraft.
5. During RWY 22/26 configuration, issue the following:
    1. Kona Departure.
    2. West Loch Departure.

## 2.2 - Standard IFR Departure Clearances

1. Local IFR Routes have been developed to standardize the clearance items and strip-marking procedures for aircraft requesting local IFR departure clearances.

1. During East Ops:
    1. Practice Approaches to RW 4R and 8L as well as departures to JRF and NGF will receive 155 Heading.
    2. Departures to HHI will receive 155 Heading.
2. During West Ops:
    1. Departures to JRF, HHI and NGF will receive 220 Heading.

## 2.4 - CPDLC and PDCs
