   4. North Tower must quick look South Tower and vise-versa.
2. LC may delegate that portion of a closed runway that does not intersect with an active runway to GC for the purpose to crossing.
3. Hold lines between runways 4L/22R and 4R/22L are 20 feet apart. Do not clear an aircraft to depart behind an aircraft holding between the runways. Do not clear an aircraft to depart behind an aircraft holding between the runways.
4. Multiple runway crossings with a single clearance are authorized for the following:
   1. Runway 4R/22L and 4L/22R at TWY F
   2. Runway 4R/22L and 4L/22R at TWY D

![Honolulu Airspace](img/hnl-airspace.png){ align=left }

1. Runway 4/8 –Tower airspace is defined as Area B and Area C. The vertical limit in Area B is 2,500’. The vertical limit in Area C is 5,000’.

## 4.3 - Land and Hold-Short Operations

| Landing Runway | Hold Short Point | Available Landing Distance |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|:--------------------------:|

## 4.4 - Line Up and Wait

1. LUAW procedures are authorized at HNL. Such operations are generally viewed as necessary to maintain airport efficiency. Use LUAW when it is expected the aircraft will depart after conflicting traffic is clear of the runway/intersection. Utilize good operating practices and memory aids as needed when using LUAW procedures.
2. LUAW is authorized at HNL except when the ceiling is below 800ft or visibility below 2nm.
3. Landing clearence need not be withheld if traffic is holding in position.

## 4.5 - Departure Procedures

1. LC shall provide separation for aircraft in the LC airspace.
2. LC shall provide initial radar separation between all successive departures.
3. LC will request departure releases from TRACON for all IFR Departures.
4. LC may opt to use rolling calls if TRACON provides blanket releases.
5. LC will ensure that all IFR departures communication will be transferred to TRACON within ½ mile of the end of the runway.
6. VFR departures will remain with LC until leaving LC airspace. Upon leaving LC airspace, the aircraft will be handed off to TRACON unless they are departing the Class Bravo to the North and did not request flight following.
7. VFR departures not requesting flight following who are departing the airspace to the north, shall be instructed to remain clear of the Class Bravo.

## 4.6 - Arrival Procedures

1. LC shall be responsible for separation of all arrival aircraft that have been handed off by TRACON from all departing aircraft still under LC jurisdiction.
2. LC shall be responsible for separation of all operating IFR aircraft under the LC jurisdiction from all operating VFR aircraft.
3. LC shall provide VFR arrivals with clearances into the Class Bravo, entry instructions into the pattern and the altimeter.
4. Wide-body and four engine turbojets landing on 4R are not allowed to turn left onto taxiway K without LC approval.

## 4.7 - Departure Releases

1. LC will request a departure release for all IFR departures unless a blanket release is authorized by the TRACON controller.
2. Departure releases will include:
   1. Aircraft Callsign
   2. SID or Initial Waypoint
   3. Departure Runway

## 4.8 - Missed Approaches/Go-Arounds

- Advise aircraft on a **visual** missed approach in East Ops to fly heading 150, climb and maintain 5,000ft and expect vectors to final approach course by contacting TRACON.
- Advise aircraft on a **visual** missed approach in West Ops to fly heading 180, climb and maintain 4,000ft and expect vectors to final approach course by contacting TRACON.
- Advise aircraft on an **instrument** missed approach to fly the published missed approach and contact TRACON.

## 4.10 - LC1 Responsibilities when split

1. Will have responsibility for operations on RWY 8L, 4L, and 4R
2. Handles all runway crossings
3. Manages ground traffic on taxiways at the approach end of RWY8L
4. Manages ground traffic on taxiways between RWY 8L and 4R not including those Taxiways dele-gated to LC2
5. Shall have automatic release authority for aircraft departing on the Redhill, Freeway, and Punch-bowl VFR departure routes. LC1 will issue a traffic advisory to LC2 for Punchbowl departures.
6. LC1 must request from LC2 for all IFR aircraft departing RWY 8L, 4R/4L.
   1. PHRASEOLOGY: LC2, LC1 APREQ IFR release on (ACID), (Type aircraft), (Initial departure heading), and (RWY departing).
   2. EXAMPLE: LC1: "LC2, LC1, APREQ IFR release on CPT8700, C208 heading 120, departing RWY 4L. "
   3. RESPONSE FROM LC2: "Released " or "Follow HAL218, B717 departing RWY 8R heading 140, released."
7. When a HOLD FOR RELEASE is given to LC1 by LC2 for a departure, LC1 must place the HOLD FOR RELEASE memory aide placard on the departure strip for which the release was requested.
8. Must provide a point-out to LC2 for aircraft flying an extended downwind to RWY 4R/L.
   1. LC1 shall have approval/disapproval authority for fighter aircraft requesting the overhead approach to RWY 4R. Overhead approaches to RWY 4R must be APREQ 's by Approach Control with LC1. LC1 shall then advise LC2 of the arriving fighters.
9. LC1 is responsible for that area on taxiway RA between the runway 4R Approach hold lines. De-parting aircraft from taxiway C on taxiway RA will be held short of the Runway 4R final approach and switched to LC I frequency. LC1 will taxi aircraft in the Runway 4R final approach course on RA to avoid overflight by aircraft under their control. LC1must issue traffic to LC2 on any Punch-bowl VFR departure.
   1. PHRASEOLOGY: "Traffic, N9118Z, PA28, departing on the Punchbowl."
   2. LC2: "Traffic observed."
