## 4.4 - Line Up and Wait

1. LUAW procedures are authorized at HNL. Such operations are generally viewed as necessary to maintain airport efficiency. Use LUAW when it is expected the aircraft will depart after conflicting traffic is clear of the runway/intersection. Utilize good operating practices and memory aids as needed when using LUAW procedures.
2. The landing clearance need not be withheld if traffic is holding in position.
3. LUAW procedures are not authorized when the ceiling is below 800ft or visibility below 2nm.
4. LUAW not authorized on RWY 22R.
5. LUAW authorized on RWY 4R only when RWY 4L is closed.
    1. If an aircraft is cleared to LUAW on RWY 4R full-length, do not issue a landing clearance to any aircraft inbound to RWY 4R until the departing aircraft has been cleared for takeoff.
6. Do not authorize aircraft to simultaneously LUAW on the same runway.
7. LUAW authorized on RWY 4L at any time, however, do not issue a landing clearance to any aircraft inbound to RWY 4L until the departing aircraft has been cleared for takeoff.
8. LUAW authorized on RWY 22L when any portion of RWY 26R or RWY 26L are closed or unavailable, however, do not issue a landing clearance to any aircraft inbound to RWY 22L until the departing aircraft has been cleared for takeoff.
9. **NOTE:** LUAW of heavy aircraft on RWY 26R while arriving or departing RWY 22L is not recommended if the aircraft is entering RWY 26R from the south. Heavy aircraft may encroach on the RSA for RWY 22L.
10. Aircraft cleared to LUAW on RWY 8R must be issued traffic landing RWY 4R if aircraft will overfly RWY 8R prior to the RWY 8R departure.
    1. EXAMPLE: “Hawaiian Four Fifty-Nine, Runway Eight Right, line up and wait. Traffic Gulfstream Five, on three-mile final Runway Four Right.”
11. Aircraft arriving RWY 22R must be issued traffic authorized to LUAW on RWY 22L.
12. Aircraft arriving RWY 4R must be issued traffic authorized to LUAW on RWY 4L.
13. LUAW must not be used when there is no-radio (NORDO) arrival aircraft in tower’s airspace.

7. VFR departures not requesting flight following who are departing the airspace to the north, shall be instructed to remain clear of the Class Bravo.
8. Prior to an aircraft departing RWY 22L/22R, ensure that an arriving aircraft on RWY 26L has completed landing roll and is clear of the projected departure path. Do not allow departures from RWY 22L or 22R to over-fly aircraft on RWY 26L or TWY R3. Do not allow aircraft to depart RWY 22L/22R with aircraft ADG V and above within the projected departure path on TWY R. Ensure that arriving traffic on RWY 26L do not cross landing threshold until departure on RWY 22L/22R is south of RWY 26L, is turning to avoid a conflict, or in the case of a West Loch Departure, has been instructed to remain north of RWY 26L.
