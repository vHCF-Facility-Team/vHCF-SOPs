# 3. Local Control

## 3.1 - Responsibilities

1. LC is responsible for all aircraft operating in the class “D” airspace.
2. LC is responsible for selecting the active runways based on the weather conditions.
3. LC must communicate runway changes with the appropriate Center Controller as well as GC and must ensure that all controllers are ready for the switch.
4. LC shall not start radar track on any aircraft, Molokai Tower is not a radar equipped tower.
5. Pilots requesting to depart from Kalaupapa Airport on an IFR flight plan via the Kalaupapa SID will call MKK Tower for clearance.
   1. MKK Tower will relay clearance and release instructions to the pilot and advise to contact HCF Center on 124.100 when climbing above 1,500’.
   2. Molokai Airport and Kalaupapa Airport should be treated as one airport when issuing departure clearances

## 3.2 - Departure Procedures

The following Departure SIDs are available at PHMK:

1. LC shall provide proper spacing to all aircraft in the Molokai class “D” airspace.
2. Departure releases are required at Molokai.
3. Aircraft has to be airborne within 1 minutes after receiving a release. If unable, Tower will request a new release.
4. LC shall transfer communication to HCF Center as soon as feasible after departure.
5. VFR departures remaining within the class “D” airspace shall remain on the tower frequency
6. IFR departures shall be assigned departure instructions based on the following IFR Departure Headings table:

| Runway | Heading |

| 17, 23 and 35 No SID | Runway Heading or assigned |
| 05 BLUSH# | Fly the SID |
| 05 HAPAI# | Fly the SID |
| 17 and 23 KALAE# | RNAV to KALAE |
| 05 MAULA# | RNAV to MAULA |
| HMK# (Kaunakakai) | Fly the Obstacle Departure |

7. Diverse Vector Area (DVA)
   1. RWY 5: N/A
   2. RWY 17: 125° CW 195° out to 15 NM
   3. RWY 23: 120° CW 040° out to 20 NM
   4. RWY 35: N/A

## 3.3 - Arrival Procedures

1. LC is responsible for proper separation of all aircraft under their control.
2. LC shall provide VFR aircraft with entry instructions into the pattern.

## 3.4 - Missed Approaches/Go-Arounds

1. Advise aircraft on an **instrument** approach to fly the published missed approach and to contact HNL_03_CTR.
2. Advise aircraft on a **visual** approach for runway 05 fly heading 360, climb and maintain 4,000ft and contact HNL_03_CTR.
3. Advise aircraft on a **visual** approach fly runway heading, climb and maintain 4,000ft and contact HNL_03_CTR.

## 3.5 - Closed Traffic

1. VFR aircraft may operate in the pattern at or below 2,000 feet.

## 3.6 - Opposite Direction Operations

1. Scope. These procedures apply to same runway ODO at MKK between an:
   1. Arrival and a departure
   2. Arrival and an arrival
2. Definition. Opposite Direction Operations: IFR/VFR Operations conducted to the same or parallel runway where an aircraft is operating in a reciprocal direction of another aircraft arriving, departing, or conducting an approach.
3. Responsibilities.
   1. Local Control and HCF share the responsibilities to coordinate ODO and issue traffic advisories.
   2. HCF is responsible for application of cutoff points and ensuring vertical separation between arriving and departing aircraft and between successive ODO arrivals.
4. Procedures for Aircraft Receiving IFR Services.
   1. General
      1. These procedures are applicable only when HCF radar is operational.
      2. ODO procedures are applicable when two aircraft will execute approaches to opposite ends of the same runway, or an aircraft will depart prior to an arrival on an opposite direction approach to the same runway.
      3. Traffic advisories must be issues to both aircraft
         1. Example - “OPPOSITE DIRECTION TRAFFIC (distance) MILE FINAL, (type aircraft).”; “OPPOSITE DIRECTION TRAFFIC DEPARTING RUNWAY (number), (type aircraft).”; “OPPOSITE DIRECTION TRAFFIC (position), (type aircraft).”
      4. Opposite direction same runway operations with opposing traffic inside the cutoff point is not allowed unless an emergency situation exists.
      5. Use of visual separation is not authorized for aircraft receiving IFR services that are conducting ODO to the same runway.
   2. Coordination
      1. LC and HCF are responsible for initiating coordination required to accomplish an opposite direction arrival or departure.
      2. Tower must verbally request opposite direction departures with TRACON.
      3. HCF must verbally request opposite direction arrivals with Tower.
   3. Cutoff Procedures: For aircraft receiving IFR services and conducting opposite direction same runway operations:
      1. Arrival / Departure: A departing aircraft must be airborne and issued a turn prior to an arriving aircraft reaching:
         1. A point **ten (10)** flying miles from the airport.
         2. If vertical separation is being used in conjunction with a cutoff point, then the arriving aircraft may continue past the cutoff point as long as vertical separation is maintained; however, the aircraft must not be cleared for an approach once inside of the cutoff point unless an emergency situation exists (i.e. action must be taken to resequence aircraft.)
            1. ***EXAMPLE***: When the departure is below the MIA and cannot be turned prior to the arrival reaching the cutoff point, vertical separation must be applied. Arriving aircraft cleared to the MKK VORTAC or JEMKO to hold at an altitude that will be vertically separated from the departure.
      2. Arrival / Arrival
         1. MKK Tower must advice HCF of the arrival of the first aircraft prior to an opposite direction arrival aircraft being issued an approach clearance. The second arriving aircraft should be cleared to the MKK VORTAC or JEMKO to hold at an altitude that will be vertically separated from the missed approach altitude of the first aircraft.
         2. If an aircraft is established in the traffic pattern, MKK Tower will ensure the arrival has crossed the runway threshold prior to that aircraft turning base leg.
      3. If the above conditions are not met, action must be taken to ensure control instructions are issued to protect the integrity of the cutoff points.
5. Procedures for VFR/VFR and VFR/IFR Operations:
   1. MKK Tower must issue traffic to both aircraft and indicate the direction that the departure will turn (arrival vs departure) or the location of the opposing aircraft on final (arrival vs arrival).
   2. MKK Tower will ensure VFR aircraft are issued a turn to avoid conflict with opposing IFR/VFR traffic.
   3. If coordination with HCF is required, MKK Tower will state the phrase “OPPOSITE DIRECTION.”
