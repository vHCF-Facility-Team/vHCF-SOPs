# 3. Ground Control

## 3.1 - Responsibilities

1. GC is responsible for the movement of all aircraft on the movement area to and from the runways.
2. GC has control of all taxiways except taxiway A between RWY 2 / 20 and RWY 5 / 23.
3. GC shall ensure pilots have the current ATIS prior to receiving taxi clearance.
4. GC shall ensure aircraft are squawking Mode Charlie and their assigned beacon code prior to issuing a taxi clearance.
5. When Runway 2/5 are in use, assign air taxi operators at the CAT the approach end of Runway 5 and air carrier operators the approach end of Runway 2. When Runways 20/23 are in use, assign all aircraft, except those operating on the East Ramp, the approach end of Runway 20, with required instructions to hold short of (or cross) Runway 23.
6. When Runway 2/5 are in use, GC shall assign CATI/II aircraft Taxiway “E” on the east ramp for intersection departures and Taxiway “K” when runways 20/23 are in use.
7. GC shall ensure that all RWY crossings are coordinated with LC unless blanket crossings are in effect.

## 3.2 - Non-Movement Areas

1. Ramp/Gate Locations/Operations
   1. **Air Carriers.** Operate on concrete ramp east of main terminal building.
   2. **Air Taxi Operators.** Operate at the Commuter Air Terminal (CAT) and on the East Ramp.
   3. **Cargo Operations.** Aloha Airlines Cargo operates out of the South Ramp. United Parcel Service operates out of gate 1 and the South Ramp.
   4. **General Aviation Operations.** Marked tie down parking available on the East Ramp. General aviation transient parking is north of the T-Hangars. Business jets are normally parked on the middle or southern portion of the East Ramp.

## 3.3 - Push backs

1. With the exception of the B777 and the A330, the tower does not control push backs and should merely acknowledge that the push back is in progress.
   1. Example – “ACID, ROGER.” Or “Push back will be at your own risk (reason and additional instructions as necessary).”
2. The B777/A330 will block taxiway Alpha upon pushback due to the length of the aircraft and the existing ramp configuration. These aircraft will contact Tower for pushback and will require ATC clearance onto taxiway alpha.

## 3.4 - Airport Ground Restrictions

1. Helicopter Air Terminal (HAT)
   1. Fixed wing aircraft may not operate on the HAT.
   2. Military helicopters are not authorized to operate at the HAT.
2. Commuter Air Terminal (CAT). Use of the CAT ramp is restricted to those operators based there.
3. Runways and Taxiways.
   1. Taxiway C east of RWY 02 is closed to all fixed wing operations.
   2. Aircraft holding short of runway 2/20 at hold lines may block taxiway Alpha depending on type of aircraft holding and the type of aircraft taxing.
   3. Aircraft holding short on the east side of runway 20 blocks runway 23 and aircraft holding short on the west side of runway 23 blocks runway 20.
4. Other.
   1. Helicopters on a Search and Rescue mission may park on the East Ramp.
   2. Military aircraft are assigned parking on a case by case basis and are normally assigned to park at the HAZMAT (including Coast Guard C-130)

## 3.5 - Departure Runways and Taxi Routes

1. Aircraft not taxiing for takeoff shall be assigned taxiway “F” for crossing runway 2/20, to/from the east ramp.
2. Unless otherwise coordinated, when runway 2/5 are in use, aircraft shall be assigned a departure runway and a taxi route as follows:
   1. The standard taxi routes to AER 2 are:
      1. From the main ramp – via Taxiway Alpha.
      2. From east ramp – via Taxiway Echo & Alpha.
      3. From the CAT – via Taxiway Foxtrot & Alpha.
   2. The standard taxi routes to AER 5 are:
      1. From the main ramp – via Taxiway Alpha & Foxtrot.
      2. From east ramp – via Taxiway Foxtrot.
      3. From the CAT – via Taxiway Foxtrot.
   3. All heavy and B757 aircraft shall be assigned runway 2/20.
   4. Large jet and turboprop aircraft shall be assigned runways 2 for departure. Aircraft weighing 270,000 pounds or less may be assigned runway 5 upon pilot request due to wind or for other aircraft performance and/or operational purposes/requirements. The proximity of taxiway “F” to the terminal building limits runway 5 access to aircraft with the wingspan of a C-130 or smaller (133’)
   5. Category I/II aircraft shall be assigned taxiway “E” on the east ramp and Runway 5 from the commuter air terminal (CAT).
3. Except for unusual situations or conditions, aircraft shall be assigned a departure runway and taxi routes when South Flow (runways 20/23 are in use) as prescribed below:
   1. The standard taxi routes to AER 20:
      1. From the main ramp – via Taxiway Alpha to hold short of (or cross) Runway 23.
      2. From east ramp – via Taxiway Foxtrot & Alpha.
      3. From the CAT – via Taxiway Foxtrot & Alpha.
   2. Category I/II aircraft shall be assigned taxiway “K” on the east ramp for departure; GC shall assign all other aircraft the AER 20.
   3. LC may, at his/her discretion, use the intersection at Alpha and runway 23, the intersection of runways 20/23, or the AER 23 to depart CAT I/II aircraft.
   4. Large jet and turboprop aircraft may be assigned runway 23 for departure upon pilot request due to wind or for other aircraft performance and/or operational purposes/requirements.
