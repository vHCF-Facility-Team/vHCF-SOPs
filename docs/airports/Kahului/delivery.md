## 2.6 - Helicopter Operating Procedures

1. Frequency assignments for departing helicopters are based upon the following:
   1. Eastbound tour helicopters assigned the Crater One Departure are issued departure frequency 119.500. Eastbound tour helicopters departing north of Haleakala Highway and requesting/requiring radar service beyond tower airspace are issued departure frequency 120.200.
   2. Westbound tour helicopters to Waihe’e, Ia’o, and Waikapu Valleys are assigned tower frequency 118.700, as radar service and radio communications are not available in the valley due to coverage.
   3. Helicopters not desiring Class C services beyond the tower’s designated Class C airspace are instructed to remain on tower frequency after departure.
   4. All other helicopters that will receive Class C services beyond the tower’s designated Class C airspace are assigned a computer-generated VFR beacon code, and issued the departure frequency of the approach sector they will enter first.
2. Assign **all** eastbound VFR helicopters at or below 2,000 feet during standard flow (runways 2/5) operations.
